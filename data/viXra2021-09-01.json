{"vixra_id":"2111.0117","title":"Relativistic Equation Failure for LIGO Signals","abstract":"Signal waves of the monotone increasing frequency detected by LIGO are universally considered to be gravitational waves of spiral binary stars, and the general theory of relativity is thus universally considered to have been confirmed by the experiments. Here we present a universal method for signal wave spectrum analysis, introducing the true conclusions of numerical calculation and image analysis of GW150914 signal wave. Firstly, numerical calculation results of GW150914 signal wave frequency change rate obey the com quantization law which needs to be accurately described by integers, and there is an irreconcilable difference between the results and the generalized relativistic frequency equation of the gravitational wave. Secondly, the assignment of the frequency and frequency change rate of GW10914 signal wave to the generalized relativistic frequency equation of gravitational wave constructs a non-linear equation group about the mass of wave source, and the computer image solution shows that the equation group has no GW10914 signal wave solution. Thirdly, it is not unique to calculate the chirp mass of the wave source from the different frequencies and change rates of the numerical relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal wave, and the numerical relativistic waveform of the GW150914 signal wave deviates too far from the original waveform actually. Other LIGO signal waveforms do not have obvious characteristics of gravitational frequency variation of spiral binary stars and lack precise data, so they cannot be used for numerical analysis and image solution. Therefore, LIGO signals represented by gw50914 signal do not support the relativistic gravitational wave frequency equation. However, whether gravitational wave signals from spiral binaries that may be detected in the future follow the same co quantization law? Only the numerical analysis results of detailed observation data can give an accurate answer.","primary_category":"Quantum Gravity and String Theory","authors":["X. D.

{"vixra_id":"2111.0116","title":"A Refractive Index of a Kink in Curved Space","abstract":"The refractive index and curvature relation is formulated using the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor. As a consequence of the fourth rank tensor of the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor, we found that the refractive index should be a second rank tensor. The second rank tensor of the refractive index describes a linear optics. It implies naturally that the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor is related to the linear optics. In case of a non-linear optics, the refractive index is a sixth rank tensor, if susceptibility is a fourth rank tensor. The Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor can be formulated in the non-linear optics but with a reduction term. The relation between the (linear and non-linear) refractive index and a (linear and non-linear) mass in curved space are formulated. Related to the Riemann-Christoffel curvature tensor, we formulate \"the (linear and non-linear) generalized Einstein field equations\". Sine-Gordon model in curved space is shown, where the Lagrangian is the total energy.  This total energy is the mass of a kink (anti-kink) associated with a topological charge (a winding number). We formulate the relation between the (linear and non-linear) refractive index of the kink (anti-kink) and the topological charge-the winding number. Deflection of light is discussed in brief where the (linear and non-linear) angle of light deflection are formulated in relation with the mass (the topological charge, the winding number) of the kink (anti-kink).","primary_category":"Mathematical Physics","authors":["Miftachul Hadi"],"published":"2021-11-24"}

{"vixra_id":"2111.0107","title":"The Morbid Equation of Quantum Numbers","abstract":"The quantum model of valence electron generation orbital penetration of alkali metal elements with unique stable structure is investigated. The electric field outside the atomic kernel is usually expressed by the Coulomb field of the point charge mode, and the composite electric field in atomic kernel can be equivalent to the electric field inside the sphere with uniform charge distribution or other electric fields without divergence point. The exact solutions of two Schrodinger equations for the bound state of the Coulomb field outside the atom and the binding state of the equivalent field inside the atom determine two different quantization energy formulas respectively. Here we show that the atomic kernel surface is the only common zero potential surface that can be selected. When the orbital penetration occurs, the law of conservation of energy requires that the energy level formulas of the two bound states must have corresponding quantum numbers to make them equal. As a result, there is no solution to the quantum number equation, indicating that the two quantum states of the valence electron are incompatible. This irreconcilable contradiction shows that the quantized energy of quantum mechanics cannot absolutely satisfy the law of conservation of energy.","primary_category":"Quantum Physics","authors":["X.

{"vixra_id":"2111.0106","title":"Gravity, Quantum Mechanics and MOND","abstract":"Most attempts to unite Quantum Mechanics (QM) and Gravity are focussed at the extreme energies of the Standard Model (SM), This paper, in complete contrast, approaches the problem from the opposite end of the energy spectrum. It starts by building the fundamental particles from infinite superpositions that fit the SM, apart from infinitesimal differences, with possibly profound consequences. All fundamental particles have at least an infinitesimal mass always inverse to the horizon radius. Cosmic wavelength (kmin) gravitons vastly outnumber all other particles and the invariant action they require comes from the horizon. Its surface area is always proportional to the density of matter and cosmic mass is always proportional to the horizon radius. When mass is distributed evenly as dust, gravitons have uniform spatial density. To maintain action invariance, the metric changes around mass concentrations in agreement with Einstein\u2019s equations, apart from an infinitesimal difference effective only at cosmic radii. In large regions of space this difference makes the values of the Einstein tensor components in the Freidman equations average zero. Space is always flat, and Quantum Mechanics (QM) controls the expansion of space regardless of Omega, with or without inflation. The scale factors in the radiation era, and the start of the matter era, are similar to Lambda-CDM cosmology. Milrom\u2019s acceleration a0 has an inverse length that is always proportional to the maximum (kmin) graviton wavelength. This may facilitate early super-massive black hole generation. Just as the three SM coupling constants change at high energies, this paper proposes that the graviton coupling constant increases inversely with local acceleration when the gravitational gradient is less that a0, but with an exponential cutoff close to halo radii. This behaves like an added mass, making low mass galaxies more MOND-like, and massive ones less so. Even though galaxies are not gravitationally bound, as the scale factor increases these vast MOND regions increase their volume, which adds more of this phantom-like mass and accelerates the expansion, just like dark energy. An approximate model of this (with just one free parameter related to the fraction of phantom mass) gives a deceleration parameter q0 = -1.16, and a transition redshift of approximately zt = 0.37, but it can be adjusted to fit deceleration\/redshift surveys.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Julian Williams"],"published":"2021-11-20"}

{"vixra_id":"2111.0092","title":"On the Relativity of the Speed of Light","abstract":"Einstein's assumption that the speed of light is constant is a fundamental principle of modern physics with great influence. However, the nature of the principle of constant speed of light is rarely described in detail in the relevant literatures, which leads to a deep misunderstanding among some readers of special relativity. Here we introduce the unitary principle, which has a wide application prospect in the logic self consistency test of mathematics, natural science and social science. Based on this, we propose the complete space-time transformation including the Lorentz transformation, clarify the definition of relative velocity of light and the conclusion that the relative velocity of light is variable, and further prove that the relative variable light speed is compatible with Einstein's constant speed of light. The specific conclusion is that the propagation speed of light in vacuum relative to the observer's inertial reference frame is always constant c, but the propagation speed of light relative to any other inertial reference frame which has relative motion with the observer is not equal to the constant c; observing in all inertial frame of reference, the relative velocity of light propagating in the same direction in vacuum is 0, while that of light propagating in the opposite direction is 2c. The essence of Einstein's constant speed of light is that the speed of light in an isolated reference frame is constant, but the relative speed of light in vacuum is variable. The assumption of constant speed of light in an isolated frame of reference and the inference of relative variable light speed can be derived from each other.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["X.

In this case, where the spacetime is dynamic, if we zoom in to a specific time slice of the internal Schwarzschild metric, we get the Minkowski-equivalent FRW metric for flat space with a spatial scale factor that depends on the specific time slice at which we are looking.  By solving for the unknowns in the internal Schwarzschild metric using cosmological data, we obtain values for the scale factor at different times which can then be used in the FRW metric to obtain energy densities of the Universe at various times.  No cosmological constant is required because the internal Schwarzschild metric provides a scale factor that generates a slowing expansion for some time after the Big Bang followed by an accelerated expansion that ultimately ends in a Big Rip.  The entire Schwarzschild metric in Kruskal-Sezekeres coordinates is examined and we see that it describes two CPT symmetric Universes moving in opposite directions in the time dimension.  One Universe contains matter while the other contains antimatter.  When these Universes meet at the singularity, they annihilate each other resulting in a single, massless, pure radiation Universe.  This state regenerates the Big Bang conditions where the radiation decays into matter and antimatter pairs, resulting in a new cycle where the two Universes again fall in time.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["C.

A summarized result of the {N,n\/\/6} QM structure has been given for each region of this (Master) Periodic Table, including the cosmic {N,n\/\/6} QM (at N > 5), the Solar {N,n\/\/6} QM (at N= 5..-5), the chemical bond dominated world (at N= -2..-11), the atomic and nuclear {N,n\/\/6} QM (at N= -12..-15), and the elementary particles and sub-quark {N,n\/\/6} QM (at N \u2264 -16). The common properties (that across all regions of the Master Period Table) has been discussed. For example, by adding many short-life intermediate states (n\u2019 = 1..6^6) in between the major quantum state n=1..5, we can transform a quantum description (with n=1..5} into a (continuous) classical physics description (with n\u2019 = 1..6^6). 2) For the Schrodinger equation-based part, we summarized that how to use {N,n\/\/6} QM plus non-Born probability (NBP) plus Simultaneous-Multi-Eigen-Description (SMED) to describe a planet (or an atom in this planet) that orbiting around Sun, and a photon that propagating away (or towards to) a (Bohr) atom (and it can also be used for a 180\u00b0 scattering). We further discussed the possibility to extend this description for any kind of movement (elliptical\/parabolic\/hyperbolic orbiting, scattering, etc.), with any inclination\/eccentricity\/precession. We also discussed how to use Schrodinger equation\/solution for the N-body movement description. We pointed out that there is a conceptual difference between the {N,n} QM and the traditional QM in describing the H-atom\u2019s electron orbit: while the probability (i.e., the Born probability) is the foundation of the traditional QM, the single trajectory (i.e., NBP peak\u2019s time-dependent trajectory) is the foundation of the {N,n} QM (although this single trajectory will pick one of the many possible tracks based on the probability). 3) In the cosmic {N,n\/\/6} QM, we explored the possibility that those super large cosmic \u201cgreat walls\u201d with distances ~ 9E+9 light-years from Earth are the (~ 9E+9 years old) self-images of our own Milky Way galaxy and be viewed at different angles. If this is correct, then our universe may should be a positive curved 3D space, with the circumference of ~ 9E+9 light-years. This means, just like we are practically living in the 2D spherical space on the surface of a 3D ball something (i.e., a planet), we may practically live in the 3D spherical space on the surface of a 4D ball something. 4) We pointed out that the wave mechanics is equally powerful as that of particle mechanics in solving a QM problem, and a particle mechanics based holographic-description and SMED is waiting to be developed. 5) Because the Bohr formula rn = r1 * n^2 correlates to the (free-fall) accelerated distance formula d = (1\/2) *g *t^2 and Newton formula F = m * a, we believed that Bohr formula is the Number-One important formula in physics. We believed that all these results make {N,n} QM theory becomes one of the most (roughly) completed and (roughly) self-consistent theories in physics.","primary_category":"Quantum Physics","authors":["Yi Cao"],"published":"2021-11-17"}

First of all, different from the theravada Buddhism\u2019s traditional view that \u201cMount Sumeru(Meru)\u201d is located in the Himalayas for thousands of years, this paper comprehensively proves that the central location of \u201cMount Sumeru(Meru)\u201d is related to the earth\u2019s south magnetic pole.

In this paper, I introduce discriminator variance regularization to regularize the discriminator of Wasserstein GAN to have a small Lipschitz constant. Discriminator variance regularization simply regularizes the variance of the discriminator's output to be small when input is real data distribution or generated data distribution. Intuitively, a low variance of discriminator output implies that the discriminator is more likely to have a low Lipschitz constant. Discriminator variance regularization does not explicitly regularize the Lipschitz constant of discriminator through differentiation on discriminator but lowers the probability that the Lipschitz constant of the discriminator is high. Discriminator variance regularization is used in Wasserstein GAN with R1 regularization, which reduces the vibration of GAN. Discriminator variance regularization requires very little additional computing.","primary_category":"Artificial Intelligence","authors":["Jeongik Cho"],"published":"2021-11-24"}

The main results are (1) to prove with modest axioms that some real numbers are greater than any natural number, (2) to develop a technique for taking a limit at infinity via the ordinary Cauchy definition reliant on the classical epsilon-delta formalism, and (3) to demonstrate an infinite number of non-trivial zeros of the Riemann zeta function in the neighborhood of infinity.  We define numbers in the neighborhood of infinity as Cartesian products of Cauchy equivalence classes of rationals.  We axiomatize the arithmetic of such numbers, prove the operations are well-defined, and then make comparisons to the similar axioms of a complete ordered field.

As a result, gravity-like effects appear in between entangled particles that they be real or virtual. Long range, massless gravity results from entanglement of massless virtual particles. Entanglement of massive virtual particles leads to massive gravity contributions at very smalls scales. Multi-folds mechanisms also result into a spacetime that is discrete, with a random walk fractal structure and non-commutative geometry that is Lorentz invariant and where spacetime nodes and particles can be modeled with microscopic black holes. All these recover General relativity at large scales and semi-classical model remain valid till smaller scale than usually expected. Gravity can therefore be added to the Standard Model. This can contribute to resolving several open issues with the Standard Model without new Physics other than gravity. These considerations hints at a even stronger relationship between gravity and the Standard Model.\r\n\r\nA subsequent analysis described how embedding a multi-fold universe in a 7D unconstrained, i.e. non compact, Kaluza-Klein (KK) flat spacetime can induce the standard model in the multi-fold spacetime. \r\n\r\nIn this paper, we illustrate how computations previous derived by others in the context of a more cabalistic model can be reused and adapted to hint at extracting, from 7D unconstrained KK flat spacetime containing the multi-fold universe, many particles of the Standard Model, and very closely predicting their masses and charges.

This is achieved by controlling automatically and at the opportune moments the perpetual and omnipresent action of Casimir attractive force between two electrodes, by an opposite and greater Coulomb force of at least a factor of two.           \r\n    The proportionality factor, Coulomb \/ Casimir Forces> = 2, is determined by the threshold voltage of enriched or depleted MOS transistors and defined during the manufacture of the device.\r\nThe attractive Casimir force appearing between the two electrodes of a reflector deforms a piezoelectric bridge, which automatically induces the electric charges used by a Coulomb force on the return electrode. \r\nAs long as the electric voltage, generated by the electric charges on one side of the piezoelectric bridge and connected to the gate of an enriched MOS transistor (MOSE) is below its threshold voltage, this transistor remains blocked. The electrical charges on the other side of the bridge are on the source of this transistor and remain confined to the moving electrode of the Casimir reflector. During this phase, the Coulomb return electrode is then grounded by closing the circuit consisting of series depleted MOS (MOSD). Likewise, the fixed electrode of the Casimir reflector is continuously grounded. The Coulomb force between the two electrodes of the Casimir reflector and between the piezoelectric bridge and the Coulomb return electrode is then zero. \r\nDepending on the deformation of the piezoelectric bridge, the electric charges present on the two electrodes of the piezoelectric bridge increase. They therefore increase on the gates of the enriched or depleted MOS and generate an electrical voltage greater than the threshold voltages of the MOSE and MOSD transistors. Thus, the circuit formed by MOSE in parallel closes and that formed by MOSD in series opens, then isolating the fixed return electrode from ground, which allows the charges present on the source to be distributed uniformly over this recall electrode and to be trapped there. Electric charges of opposite sign are then distributed over the two electrodes, one on one side of the piezoelectric bridge, the other on the return electrode! So, an attractive Coulomb force who can be greater than and in the opposite direction to that of Casimir then develops between these return  electrodes. This attractive Coulomb force moves the two electrodes away of the Casimir reflector, reducing then canceling the deformation of the bridge. It automatically disappears when the deformation of the piezoelectric bridge is canceled out, letting the Casimir force again dominate and deform this bridge again for a new cycle! The device is found in the initial conditions which causes the structure to vibrate.             When homogenizing the electrical charges on both sides of the return electrode, periodic current peaks appear for a fraction of the device's vibration time. These peaks of currents passing through an inductor spontaneously induce peaks of alternating voltages at the terminals of this device. Electronic without any power supply then transforms these weak alternating signals into a direct voltage of several volts. \r\nTo manufacture these different structures, we are proposing an original technology making it possible to produce these electronics without power supply, as well as that of the control of the very weak interfaces between the electrodes of the Casimir reflector and that of the return electrodes of the vibrating structure! \r\nThe Casimir and Coulomb forces, the current or voltage peaks appear spontaneously and without input of any external energy, likewise the transformation electronics have no power supply. \r\nThe structure automatically enters in vibrations , thus inducing current and voltage peaks converted into a usable direct voltage. Everything is only a consequence of the existence of the isotropic, homogeneous, and omnipresent Casimir force due to the quantum fluctuations of the vacuum. This set does not seem to contradict Emily Noether's theorem! \"In the universe, everything is energy, everything is vibration, from the infinitely small to the infinitely large\" Albert Einstein.  \"A person who has never made mistakes has never tried to innovate.\" Albert Einstein","primary_category":"Thermodynamics and Energy","authors":["Sangouard Patrick"],"published":"2021-11-12"}

By choosing this periods\u2019 data, we avoid the periods of China's significant stock market reforms to reduce the impact of the government's policy on the factor effect. In this paper, the redundant factors (HML, CMA) are orthogonalized, and the regression analysis of 5*5 portfolio of Size-B\/M and Size-Inv is carried out with these two orthogonalized factors. It found that the HML and the CMA are still significant in many portfolios, indicating that they have a strong explanatory ability, which is also consistent with the results of GRS test. All these show that the five-factor model has a better ability to explain the excess return rate. In the concrete analysis, this paper uses the methods of the five- factor 25-group portfolio returns calculation, the five-factor regression analysis, the orthogonal treatment, the five-factor 25-group regression and the GRS test to more comprehensively explain the excellent explanatory ability of the five-factor model to the excess return. Then, we analyze the possible reasons for the strong explanatory ability of the HML, CMA and RMW from the aspects of price to book ratio, turnover rate and correlation coefficient.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0182","title":"Original & Equivalent ABC Conjectures Proved on Two Pages","abstract":"This paper proves the original and the equivalent ABC conjectures. The hypothesis for the original conjecture is basically the same as the hypothesis for the equivalent conjectures, and this hypothesis states that there exists only finitely many triples (A, B, C) of coprime positive integers, with A + B = C.  The conclusion for the original conjecture would be that the product, d, of the distinct prime factors of A, B and C, is usually not much smaller than C. This conclusion would be interpreted as |C \u2013 d| < \u03b5, where \u03b5 is a positive real number. The conclusions for the equivalent conjectures would be the following: 1. C > rad(d)^(1 + \u03b5), 2.  C< K(rad(d))^(1 + \u03b5), where K is a constant, and K is a function of \u03b5, a positive real number,  3. q(a, b, c) = (logC\/(log(rad(d)))) > 1 + \u03b5; However, for the equivalent conjectures, one will apply the conclusions containing the constant K, since their solutions for \u03b5 can readily be applied in the epsilon-delta proofs in this paper. One will also introduce the constant K into q(a, b, c) = (logC\/(log(rad(d)))) > 1 + \u03b5 to obtain (logC\/(log(rad(d)))) < K(1 + \u03b5).  Thus, the conclusions to be used for the equivalent conjectures are 1, C< K(rad(d))^(1 + \u03b5), equivalently, {(logC \u2013 logK -log(rad(d)))\/(log(rad(d)))} < \u03b5; \r\n 2. {(logC\/(log(rad(d)))} < K(1 + \u03b5), equivalently, {(logC\u2013 Klog(rad(d)))\/(Klog(rad(d)))} < \u03b5.  Let H = | A + B \u2013 C |. Then |H| < \u03b4 (\u03b4 being a positive real number) would be the hypothesis; and let |L| < \u03b5 be the conclusion for the original conjecture with L = C \u2013 d. For the equivalent conjectures, let L < \u03b5 be the equivalent conclusion, where L = (log C\u2013 logK \u2013 log(rad(d)))\/(log(rad(d)));  L = (logC\u2013 Klog(rad(d)))\/(Klog(rad(d))).

Although General Relativity\u2019s direct predictions have been systematically confirmed, the dominant cosmological model thought to follow from it\u2014the \u039bCDM (Lambda cold dark matter) model of the Universe\u2019s history and composition\u2014faces considerable challenges, including various observational anomalies and experimental failures to detect dark matter, dark energy, or inflation-field candidates. This paper shows that Einstein\u2019s Equivalence Principle entails two possible physical interpretations of General Relativity\u2019s field equations. Although the field equations facially appear to support the standard interpretation\u2014that gravity consists of mass-energy curving spacetime\u2014the field equations can be equivalently understood as holding that gravitational effects instead result from mass-energy logarithmically accelerating the metric-expansion of a second-order Euclidean spacetime fabric superimposed upon an absolute, first-order Euclidean space, resulting in the observational appearance of spacetime curvature. This alternative interpretation of relativity is shown to be empirically equivalent to the standard interpretation. It is then shown to potentially resolve every major observational anomaly for the \u039bCDM model, including recent observations that conflict with the \u039bCDM\u2019s predictions, as well as the failure to directly detect dark matter, dark energy, and inflation field candidates. On the new interpretation of relativity defended, observational data currently taken to be evidence for \u2018dark energy\u2019, \u2018dark matter\u2019, and \u2018inflation\u2019 instead just are measurement artifacts of gravity, where gravity is interpreted non-standardly in terms of accelerated second-order metric expansion.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Marcus Arvan"],"published":"2021-11-23"}

The law of excluded middle falls short of explaining the contradictory meanings of the same symbols. The statements like ``$m\\to 0$'', ``$r\\to 0$'', ``$q\\to 0$'', used by the physicist, are inconsistent on dimensional grounds because ``$ m$'', ``$r$'', ``$q$'' represent {\\it quantities} with physical dimensions of  $[M], [L], [Q]$ respectively and ``$0$'' represents just a number -- devoid of physical dimension. Consequently, the involvement of the statement ``$\\lim_{q\\to 0}$, where $q$ is the test charge'' in the definition of electric field, leads to either circular reasoning or a contradiction regarding the experimental verification of the smallest charge in the Millikan-Fletcher oil drop experiment.\r\n\r\n Considering such issues as problematic, by choice, I make an inquiry regarding the basic language in terms of which physics is written, with an aim of exploring how truthfully the verbal statements can be converted to the corresponding physico-mathematical expressions, where ``physico-mathematical'' signifies the involvement of physical dimensions. Such investigation necessitates an explanation by demonstration of ``self inquiry'', ``middle way'', ``dependent origination'', ``emptiness\/relational existence'', which are certain terms that signify the basic tenets of Buddhism. In light of such demonstration I explain my view of  ``definition''; the relations among quantity, physical dimension and number; meaninglessness of ``zero quantity'' and the associated logico-linguistic fallacy; difference between unit and unity. Considering the importance of the notion of electric field in physics, I present a critical analysis of the definitions of electric field due to Maxwell and Jackson, along with the physico-mathematical conversions of the verbal statements. The analysis of Jackson's definition points towards an expression of the electric field as an infinite series due to the associated ``limiting process'' of the test charge. However, it brings out the necessity of a postulate regarding the existence of charges, which nevertheless follows from the definition of quantity. Consequently, I explain the notion of {\\it undecidable charges} that act as the middle way to resolve the contradiction regarding the Millikan-Fletcher oil drop experiment. In passing, I provide a logico-linguistic analysis, in physico-mathematical terms, of two verbal statements of Maxwell in relation to his definition of electric field, which suggests Maxwell's conception of dependent origination of distance and charge (i.e. $[L]\\equiv[Q]$) and that of emptiness in the context of relative vacuum (in contrast to modern absolute vacuum). This work is an appeal for the dissociation of the categorical disciplines of logic and physics and on the large, a fruitful merger of Eastern philosophy and Western science. Nevertheless, it remains open to how the reader relates to this work, which is the essence of emptiness.","primary_category":"General Science and Philosophy","authors":["Abhishek Majhi"],"published":"2021-10-24"}

It is through self-inquiry that such a change is possible, along with the realization of the essence of the middle that is otherwise excluded by choice.  The logician, who generally holds a reverential attitude towards the physicist, can then actively contribute to the betterment of physics by improving the language through which the physicist expresses his experience. The philosopher, who otherwise chooses to follow the advancement of physics and gets stuck in the trap of sophistication of language, can then be of guidance to the physicist on intellectual grounds by having the physicist's experience himself. In course of this commentary, I provide a glimpse of how a truthful conversion of verbal statements to physico-mathematical expressions unravels the hitherto unrealized connection between Heisenberg uncertainty relation and Cauchy's definition of derivative that is used in physics.

The complete manuscript of the dissertation is not published. Dissertation \u201cLimit Theorems for Random Walks on Differential Manifolds\u201d is dedicated to the generalization of classical limit theorems of Probability Theory, known as Central Limit Theorem, to the case when sequences of \u2018random variables\u2019 represent random walks on differentiable manifolds or generated by products of random elements of noncommutative locally compact groups Lie. Classical results of Probability Theory related to the summation of random variables provide a description of the family of limit laws for distribution of sums of uniformly distributed infinitesimal independent terms and establish conditions for convergence of the sums to the laws of the family. Problems related to probability distributions for sums of \u201csmall \u201c random variables were generalized in two major directions: first, it had been stated a more general problem to move from discrete random walks to Markov processes with continuous time (A.N. Kolmogorov [1], A. Y. Khintchin {2], A.V. Skorokhod [3]); second, the studies shifted to the situation in which the random variables are taking their values on sets of more general mathematical nature than n-dimensional Euclidean space, for example, differentiable manifolds and Lie groups (A. N. Kolmogorov [4],         K. Ito [5], G.A. Hunt [6], D. When [7]. In our study, we consider sequences of random walks (i.e. random processes with discrete time) of both Markov and non-Markov character on locally-compact differentiable manifolds, and the limit transition from the walks to Markov random processes with continuous time so that the \u201csteps\u201d of walks are asymptotically uniformly small, and the number of \u201csteps\u201d goes to infinity. The mentioned Markov processes (diffusion and stochastically continuous without the second type of discontinuities) are introduced \u201cconstructively\u201d, which provides the information about the properties of transition probabilities, necessary for proofs of the corresponding limit theorems. As a result, we formulate conditions of convergence, analogous to the classical theory. Limit theorems for probability distributions of products of asymptotically uniformly small random elements on Lie groups are proved as an application of the corresponding statements for manifolds. We assume no conditions related to the commutative property of measure convolutions. [Truncated to < 400 words by viXra Admin]","primary_category":"General Mathematics","authors":["Gregory M.

This direct evidence also supports the Diffusion Gravity (DG) premise that galaxies generate additional control over their population of stars via Asymmetric Near-Field (ASNF) gravity, generated by the enormous \"leverage\" of galactic masses and distances, expressed through a Galactic Scaling Ratio (GSR) and the Dirac Large Number Hypothesis (LNH), which together suggest a near-field radial acceleration for stars that orbit outside the MOND radius, r(mond)=\u221a(GM\/ao), where a 0 = 1.2 x 10^-10 m\/sec^2. Asteroid 1I\/2017 U1 as a \"test particle\" demonstrated the physical mechanism of MOND, with a putative corresponding conical geometric diffusion of virtual particles between the Sun and its L1 Lagrange point with the galaxy. NASA\/JPL data from that orbit of the Sun by the asteroid Il\/2017 U1, shows that the anomalous acceleration observed of ~4.92 x 10^-6 m\/sec^2 corresponds to a constant MOND acceleration applied to the asteroid in its hyperbolic trajectory approach asymptote, resulting in a modified departure asymptote from the Sun. This evidence suggests that the additional \"leverage\" of ASNF gravity may be the common element in MOND constant velocity rotation curves of galaxies. The results also confirm a galactic L1 point location for our Sun is likely ~4 x 10^10 meters (40M km) from the Sun in the direction of the Milky Way galactic center, and inside the perihelion of planet Mercury (46M km).","primary_category":"Astrophysics","authors":["Dale H.

This causes the high frequency group to cool and the low frequency group to heat up and the high frequency group to cool down as energy is transferred between the groups.  If an infinite ladder of such groups exists in an infinite box, then this process would cycle eternally with each group periodically cooling and reheating as a given group sheds low frequency photons to lower groups while cooling and higher energy groups dump photons into it, causing it to reheat.

Consequently, the roots of a quadratic equation are mutually inclusive. Therefore, the concerned variable can acquire multiple identities in the same process of reasoning or, at the same time.

Here, we deal with the problem of identity without making such a choice of ignorance. We demonstrate that the concept \u201cidentity of a variable\u201d is meaningful only in a given context and does not have any significance in isolation other than the symbol, that symbolizes the variable, itself. We demonstrate visually how we actually realize multiple identities of a variable at the same time, in practice, in the context of a given quadratic equation.

But the average density of the universe due to the cosmic bodies was evaluated as 3x10-28 kg\/m3, which is smaller than \u03c1c. Many scientists had expected that sufficient cosmic body mass would eventually be found to exceed \u03c1c, and thus stop the expansion of the universe. However, sufficient mass, even with dark matter, has not been found. The dominant opinion has become that the universe will expand forever, \r\nespecially as recent measurements indicate that the expansion is accelerating. This article proposes a universe of compressed stressed dark matter that does not expand forever. Rather, the expansion will stop and contract, and the universe will oscillate forever. This conclusion is based on the universe being a large body of approximate\r\nradius Ru, mass Mu, which is comprised mostly of ambient uniform density \u03c1dm of compressive stressed dark matter that has permanently existed since matter became dominant over radiation. This article demonstrates that this stressed dark matter oscillates because all its radial elements oscillate in unison with the same period TSHM = 6.47x10^10 years but variable amplitude R A which increases with R, where A = 0.14x10^26 m. This article shows that the mass associated with the stressed dark matter together with the kinetic energy of the oscillations is such that the bulk of the mass of this stressed universe is this very density \u03c1dm of stressed dark matter itself, and \u03c1dm far exceeds \u03c1c. This article demonstrates that the Hubble formula V = H R is the natural behavior of such a stressed universe, and that the expansion of such a universe presently accelerates but will eventually stop expanding and will begin to oscillate with a period TSHM = 6.47x10^10 years. Thus, this article offers a very new approach to study the universe, an approach which challenges conventional understanding with a totally new stressed model of the universe.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Roger Favreau"],"published":"2021-10-18"}

It should be noted that the use of standard optical elements reduces the cost of the optical device, which is especially important for mass production. Ease and speed of replacement are also important parameters for the usability of standard optical elements. That is why the extensive use of purchased optical elements in optical devices will simplify their operation and improve the convenience of maintenance. Selecting purchased optical components of an optical circuit is not an easy task and requires certain skills. The main problem is that the optical design stage is divided into two parts. The first part is the creation of an optical circuit from non-standard (custom) optical components with optical characteristics close to catalogue lenses. The second part is to adjust the optical components position to satisfied specification requirements. This process sometimes required several iterations. In order for the process of fitting distances in an optical system to be successful, it is necessary to take into account the properties of optical glasses such as refractive index and dispersion when choosing lens components, in addition to their focus lengths and geometrical dimensions.  It should be noted that in the catalogs of optical components there are optical parameters of lenses, and also glass parameters of the lens. This is essential information for lens designer for substitution the custom optical element on off-the-shelf lens. Problems that arise with such a replacement are based on a limited number of standard lenses and lenses components.  To get comfortable for replacement, the custom lenses components must be modified (adjust) so that optical parameters will be close enough to the parameters of the catalog lenses another word during custom lenses optimization process the lens shapes and an optical power should be fully match (in ideal case) with catalog lenses data.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0083","title":"Quantum Gravitation and Inertia","abstract":"Newton's Law of Universal Gravitation provides the basis for calculating the attraction force between two bodies, which is called the \"gravitational force\" \\cite{Newton gravitation}. This Law uses the \"mass\" of bodies.\r\n\r\nEinstein General Relativity Theory proposes to calculate this gravitational force by using the curvature of space-time. This space-time curvature is supposedly due to the same \"mass\" \\cite{Einstein}. \r\n\r\nStephan Hawkings in his book (A Brief History of Time)\\cite{Hawkings} supposes that gravitons particles of quantum mechanics are the intermediaries that \"give mass\" to the bodies. However, there is no explanation about the nature of the gravitons or how their interaction with bodies could \"give them mass\". \r\n\r\nThis paper presents a new way of explaining how the \"mass\" can be given to bodies. \r\n\r\nThe starting point is an idea proposed in 1690 by Nicolas Fatio de Duillier and revisited here with new hypotheses, and then further developped with the use of the Bohmian quantum mechanics. It is shown, by means of reasoning and equations reflecting these reasoning, that the gravitational force between two bodies comes from the interaction between the revisited Nicolas Fatio's aether and matter atomic nuclei. \r\n\r\nIt is also shown that the \"mass\" of a body is not a real entity, but is an emerging phenomenon. This idea has already been suggested by Erick Verlinde in another context \\cite{Verlinde}. Here, the emergence of \"mass\" is given by the interaction of the aether particles with matter atomic nuclei.\r\nThe interesting point of Nicolas Fatio\u2019s theory is that it is able to solve not only the origin of gravitational force, but also the origin of inertial force. The origin of inertia comes from an induction phenomena between Nicolas Fatio's aether and matter atomic nuclei.\r\n\r\nThis paper uses Nicolas Fatio's medium own word, aether, to describe gravitation and inertia.

The basis for this is Faraday's unipolar induction, which has proven itself in practice, in combination with the calculation rules of vector analysis. The theoretical approach here is the assumption, according to Paul Dirac, that there is a magnetic field density. \r\nIn this publication the \u201cMaxwell equations\u201d are recalculated in their entirety. It is shown that both the change in the magnetic field over time and the change in the electric field over time can be derived from a second level tensor (matrix), which can be interpreted as a spatial field distortion tensor. Likewise, both the magnetic field density and the electric field density are derived from the unipolar induction according to Faraday. The magnetic field density results from the fact that the div \u20d7B is equal to the(Sp)grad B\u20d7.\r\nAnother innovation are the two field gradients grad \u20d7B , grad D\u20d7 and the velocity gradient grad \u20d7v , which can also be derived from Faraday's unipolar induction.

The experiment demonstrates that in relation to a moving system in the stationary space, the speed of the light differs depending on the speed and on the direction of movement of the system in the stationary space.

On the base of the known speed of the Earth (approximately 30 km\/s) the Michelson\u2019s expectations had been that the displacement of the interference fringes will be different at night and during the day (when the directions of the \u201cether wind\u201d caused by the movement of the Earth in its orbit around the Sun are opposite),\u2026 and will correspond to the calculations made. However, the result has been unexpected - no displacement was fixed. The problem has two reasons. The first is that the speed of light in vacuum depends on the intensity of the gravitational field. The intensity of the gravitational field near the Earth\u2019s surface is dominated by the mass of the Earth and does not change  during the revolution of the Earth around the Sun. Therefore, the speed of the electromagnetic radiation (of the light) in vacuum remains constant during the travel of the Earth through space. The second reason is the inappropriate conceptual design used in the construction of Michelson's interferometer. The difference in the speed of light between the two light beams, traveling in two opposite directions on the same arm, is completely compensated when the \u201ctwo-way light beam interferometer\u201d is used (see the arguments below). That is why, the existing difference of the speed of light due to the rotation of the Earth around its axis in the direction \u201eEast-West\u201d and \u201cWest-East\u201d (in the reference system related to the Earth's surface) cannot be established. However, that difference is observed at the experiments \u201cOne-way measurement of the speed of light\u201d and the experiment \u201cMichelson-Gale-Pearson\u201d.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0060","title":"Subtle Energies, Conscious Intent, and our Expanding Universe","abstract":"Many publications demonstrate that some scientific experiments can be affected by the act of observation, as well as the mind being affected by local astronomical forces and factors, such as gravity, electromagnetism, spin, and orientation. Subtle Energies of an unknown nature are also associated with these phenomena, and hence are a subject of this research. This paper builds on the counter intuitive findings published in NeuroQuantology Dec 2011 40, which details the ability of the mind to filter out all of the above \u201clocal\u201d factors and visualise experiments as if they were being undertaken in intergalactic space without these physical forces. In order to research this phenomenon further, it is necessary to produce quantitative experiments that isolate the above factors which cause significant superimposed perturbations in measurements. This has been achieved by adopting the techniques of scientific Noetics (or mind science), and measuring the actual physical dimensions of simple geometric shapes, and comparing them to the dimensions of the same geometric shapes perceived \u201cmentally\u201d by the body\u2019s senses.\r\nThe findings strongly suggest that Subtle Energies seem to be inextricably connected to consciousness and intent.  This unexpected conclusion is supported by mathematical results obeying power laws that involve universal constants and no arbitrary constants: such as Phi \u03d5 (The Golden Ratio 1.61083..), and Feigenbaum\u2019s Constant \u03b4 (delta 4.6692\u2026)  These formulae cannot be random results, especially as their correlation coefficients are > 0.9.  The implications are (1) that phi and delta form part of the structure of space-time, and (2) the important quantified discovery that the mind can interface with the fundamentals of space-time, the laws of physics, and objects in the cosmos. \r\nIn addition, these findings could address and help explain several topics of current academic research into fundamental areas of physics and cosmology that involve: - \r\n1.The act of making a conscious observation may affect the results of quantum physics experiments.\r\n2.Using Noetics for the experiments in this paper \u2013 i.e. specializing in the intersection of science and human experience.\r\n3.The structure of the universe and the role of Geometry is a more recent topic of growing academic interest.\r\n4.Further research into Entanglement \u2013 not only in the quantum world, but also in the everyday macro world. \r\n[Truncated by viXra Admin to < 400 words]","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Jeffrey S.

Particles, whether classical or quantum, are assumed to move with a continuous (even if uncertain) velocity. Purpose - The work prospects for a descriptive  theory of particle motion from a non-local hidden-variable (NLHV) perspective. This is worth attempting for the potential to better understand fundamental dynamics and kinematics.  Method - The new physics provided by the cordus theory was used to infer the mathematical representation of the energisation behaviour of the inner structures, specifically the reactive ends. From this the motion function of the particle as a whole was determined. Findings - In three dimensional space the motion of each reactive end is an irregular spiral displacement locus. The motion comprises a movement phase and a brief immobile phase. This is called a \u2018gait\u2019 as it is reminiscent of biological locomotion. Originality - A novel theory of particle motion is offered. The theory predicts that motion comprises a complex spiral locus of the particle. This is unique among theories of physics. Further contributions are the provision of explanations for several physical phenomena: ponderomotive force, the nature of momentum, and bremsstrahlung radiation. Specifically, the theory explains why photon emission would be increasing concentrated in the forward direction with increased electron energy. The theory provides a means to bridge quantum mechanics and special relativity, because it accommodates both particle uncertainty and field transmissions.","primary_category":"Quantum Physics","authors":["Dirk J.

In this study, images were taken from ISIC 2017 Challenge. The skin cancer images taken were preprocessed and data augmented. Later, these images were trained with transfer learning and fine-tuning approach and deep learning models were created in this way. 3 different mobile deep learning models and 3 different batch size values were determined for each, and a total of 9 models were created. Among these models, the NASNetMobile model with 16 batch size got the best result. The accuracy value of this model is 82.00%, the precision value is 81.77% and the F1 score value is 0.8038.

However, unexpectedly, in this work the electrostatic field parallel to metal surface, i.e., the tangential electrostatic field (TEF) at metal surface, may be discovered by means of mechanical-electric coupling which may originate from the strain dependent of Fermi surface energy (FSE) in metals. Further investigations indicates that the TEF at metal surface may give birth to interesting physical effects such as TEF causing variations for photoelectron emission spectroscopy, TEF-induced redistribution of minority atoms, TEF-induced Reshba effect and so on. Moreover, an electron double-dipole resonance (EDDR) mechanism may be uncovered based on the electrostatic field at the surfaces of metal nanoparticles. To one\u2019s surprise, using EDDR a simple unified model might be constructed for the longstanding problem in physics and chemistry, i.e, surface-enhanced Raman scattering (SERS). And this unified model could provide satisfactory explanations for the main experimental phenomena on SERS.

Equations of the dependence of the change in the volume of space, the rate of change in the volume and the equation of acceleration \/ deceleration of the change in the volume of space of the vortex Torus, depending on the parametric angle of its generating circle, have been obtained. Verification of a number of observational cosmic facts, which have not been explained within the existing standard cosmological model, has been verified for their full compliance with the proposed New model of the Universe in the form of a vortex Torus. For the first time, an explanation of the majority of unsolved space problems was obtained within the framework of the proposed New Model, evidence of the correspondence between theory and practice \"from one place\" was obtained, without modernizing existing standard theories and without attracting additional new ad hoc hypotheses to replace the old hypotheses that do not work. A new concept of the accelerated expansion of the Universe has been presented and practically proven, the riddle of Dark Energy has been solved: the reason for the accelerated expansion of the space of the Universe in the form of a vortex Thor has been found, due solely to its topology, which does not need the presence of any physical forces, neither known nor hypothetical! It is shown why the currently observed accelerated expansion of space is not constant, but cyclical.

The similarities of structures visible on the topographic map to the structures calculated by a computer simulation of a shallow (oblique) impact with an impact angle of 5\u00b0, provide a strong indication for the existence of the \u00d81270x950 km PT-Impact-Crater on the Arctic Ocean floor.\r\nEspecially the elliptical deep sea basin in the Arctic Ocean, the bow-shaped Brooks Range in Alaska and the northern edge of the Central Siberian Plateau (Siberian Traps), which has the same bow-wave-structure like the calculated structure, are strong indicators that the PT-Impact Crater was caused by a shallow impact of an asteroid or comet.\r\nFurther strong indication for the PT-Impact-Crater comes from a gravity anomaly map and from a magnetic anomaly map of the Arctic Ocean area and Alaska. The gravity anomaly map clearly shows sections of the elliptical crater-wall of the PT-Impact Crater (positive anomalies) . The Brooks Range in Alaska, which originally was part of the elliptical crater-wall-structure, is also indicated by a positive anomaly on the map.  This section drifted away from the PT-Crater, caused by forces of the massive amount of ejecta material that was ejected from the crater, which probably was in the range of 100.000.000 to  200.000.000 km^3 of ejecta-material !\r\nThe magnetic anomaly map of the Arctic Ocean area shows a triangular-shaped positive anomaly (red), which originates in the crater center. This indicates ejecta that was coming from an iron-rich impactor.\r\nThe big distance between the elliptical impact basin and the described bow-wave-shaped structure in Siberia, which originally was located directly at the front-end of the PT-Crater, is the result of a divergent tectonic motion and expansion tectonics process that was triggered by the shallow PT-impact. The leading edges (front edges) of the two gigantic ejecta wings which were caused by the PT-Impact, cut through Earth\u2019s crust and large amounts of impactor material (e.g. iron) and ejecta material descended into Earth\u2019s mantle and caused the Pacific-LLSVP and the African-LLSVP.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0032","title":"On the Safe Use of Prior Densities for Bayesian Model Selection","abstract":"The application of Bayesian inference for the purpose of model selection is very popular nowadays. In this framework, models are compared through their marginallikelihoods, or their quotients, called Bayes factors. However, marginal likelihoods show strong dependence on the prior choice, even when the data are very informative, unlike the posterior distribution. Furthermore, when the prior is improper, the marginal likelihood of the corresponding model is undetermined. In this work, we aim to raise awareness about the issue of prior sensitivity of the marginal likelihood and its role in model selection. We also comment on the use of uninformative priors, which are very common choices in practice.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0025","title":"What\u2019s Wrong with the Standard Model?","abstract":"The Standard Model of Elementary Particles is based on elementary excitations classified by a single spin variable (non-negative half-integer) attributed to the irreducible representations of the rotation group in three dimensions. This feature originates from a theorem of Wigner [1,2], the derivation of which utilizes a homology between the symmetry group SL(2,C) and the Lorentz group, the homogeneous symmetry of Minkowski space. In recent work [3] it has been shown that the representations of SL(2,C) and the Lorentz group differ fundamentally, and that Wigner\u2019s theorem does not apply to the latter. Consequently, elementary fields have to be classified by two indices (j, k), each a non-negative half-integer. Correspondingly, there is also no need to introduce so-called internal\r\nsymmetries, because the corresponding degrees of freedom follow directly from the second index. Furthermore, owing to the the product-nature of the representations, a mechanism can be suggested that interprets interaction as simple propagation between field factors of identical sub-index j or k [4]. This would remove the embarrassingly high number of free interaction parameters in the Standard Model.","primary_category":"High Energy Particle Physics","authors":["Paul R.

{"vixra_id":"2110.0024","title":"New Derivation of Redshift Distance Without Using Power Expansions","abstract":"Here we use the flat Friedmann-Lemaitre-Robertson-Walker metric describing a spatially homogeneous and isotropic universe to derive the cosmological redshift distance in a way which differs from that which can be found in the astrophysical literature.\r\nWe use the co-moving coordinate r_e (the subscript e indicates emission) for the place of a galaxy which is emitting photons and r_a (the subscript a indicates absorption) for the place of an observer within a different galaxy on which the photons - which were traveling thru the universe - are absorbed. Therefore the real physical distance - the way of light - is calculated by D = a(t_0) r_a - a(t_e) r_e. Here means a(t_0) the today\u2019s (t_0) scale parameter and a(t_e) the scale parameter at the time of emission (t_e) of the photons. Nobody can doubt this real travel way of light: The photons are emitted on the co-moving coordinate place r_e and are than traveling to the co-moving coordinate place r_a. During this traveling the time is moving from t_e to t_0 (t_e \u2264 t_0) and therefore the scale parameter is changing in the meantime from a(t_e) to a(t_0).\r\nUsing this right way of light we calculate some relevant classical cosmological equations (effects) and compare these\r\ntheoretical results with some measurements of astrophysics. As one result we get e.g. the today\u2019s Hubble parameter H_0a \u2248\r\n62.34 km\/(s Mpc).

Cosmological redshift is proportional to the cosmic scale factor, the relation between redshift and distance is non-linear, and the Hubble constant determines the proper velocity of space expansion. Edward A. Milne developed a competing Newtonian expanding model in static Euclidean space that is consistent with the Friedmann equation. It describes the universe as a conservative gravitational system which includes special relativity. In this model cosmic redshifts are explained as relativistic Doppler redshifts, the Hubble constant determines the peculiar velocity of matter expansion, and the relation between redshift and distance is non-linear. This paper describes a static model of the universe as a conservative gravitational system. This static model explains cosmic redshifts by time dilation in a universal gravitational field, which results in a linear redshift-distance relation that matches Hubble\u2019s 1929 discovery. The uniformity of the cosmic microwave background temperature is also explained by relativity effects in a universal gravitational field. In this model the square of the Hubble constant is the gravitational constant of cosmic gravity. The results of several different tests designed to determine whether or not space expansion is real are all consistent with the static gravitational model.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["George Park"],"published":"2021-10-03"}

People learn sort algorithms before learning other advanced algorithms. Since sorting is important, computer scientists study and try to create new\r\nsorting algorithms. The paper is composed of five themed sections: Introduction, Method, Analyzis, Experiment Result, and Conclusion. The first section of this paper will give a brief overview of the algorithm and introduce a new way to sort a list called PT sort, a non-comparison integer sorting algorithm that is based on subtracting the\r\nlargest exponent with radix two, then using recursion and traverse on every separated list. Section two and three begins by laying out the theoretical dimensions of the research, proposes the methodology, and analyzes the time complexity of PT sort. The forth section presents the findings of the research, focusing on the result of the experiment. The time complexity and space complexity of PT sort is approximatly ??(?? \u2219 log2 ??) where n is the number of the numbers being sorted and r is the largest number in the list.","primary_category":"Data Structures and Algorithms","authors":["Yu-Cheng Liu"],"published":"2021-10-01"}

There are billions of financial transactions which are taking place and all this data is stored and can be considered as a gold mine of data for many different organizations. No human intelligence can dig in this amount of data to come up with something valuable. This is the reason financial organizations are employing artificial intelligence to come up with new algorithms which can change the way financial transactions are being carried out. Artificial Intelligence can complete the task in a very short period. Artificial intelligence can be used to detect frauds, identify possible attacks, and any other kind of anomalies that may be detrimental for the institution.

The model eventually involves the supposition of inhomogeneous negative pressure arising from the vacuum dependant upon void scale, and the effects that might be observed on larger scales as well as implications derived from this idea. It attempts to address the nature of dark matter and the halo problem, dark energy and accelerating expansion, and inflation.  The possibility arises that all three (in addition to other observed effects of galactic evolution) could derive from the same modeled effect assumed to be negative pressure from the vacuum arising from non uniform expansion.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Patrick Raymond Kelley"],"published":"2021-09-30"}

{"vixra_id":"2109.0214","title":"The Photon Structure in Interference Processes, Quantum Entanglement and Self-Organized Cosmos","abstract":"The standard framework of cosmology requires evaluating the quantum entanglement of primordial Planck bosons at a same quantum state. A thermodynamic feedback becomes evidence trough the Hubble\u2019s law emanating from the comoving volume, responding to the coupling of the flow energy with the imprinted dimensionality of the space-time. The pair formation in which coherence between same quantum states will manifested in an oscillatory superposition. Therefore, two almost simultaneous positions displace a wavelength value. Thus, a small identical time shapes space-time, separating the event-distance between the interactions of two photons. Hence, the energy flow at the microscopic level aligns the evolution into homogeneous phases, indicating the presence of a regulatory process over expansion connected to the universe age under flatness. The distension-contraction due to the interference of the pair of photons (or electrons) involves a sum of angular moments, at the instant of the vector re-configuration of the electric and magnetic fields. Therefore, the transitory wavelength of the photon pair superposition can be characterized by two exclusive states: constructive (distension of the E field) or destructive (contraction of the E field). Quantum entanglement acts as a dissipative coherence-decoherence oscillatory potential, with momentum conservation between rest and inertial mass. Thus, this moderates the increase in entropy as a function of the bottleneck that is the velocity of light: c, and preserving the balance between open and closed curvatures, that is, flatness of the expansion.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["A.

{"vixra_id":"2109.0207","title":"Living a Non-anthropocentric Future","abstract":"The climate change is one of the most contentious issues discussed in the public arena today.  Environmental activists contend that the climate change is not an act of nature or God but is a result of human actions.  Environmental critics do not see the degradation of the environment as merely a result of wrongheaded or misguided policies.  Their critique goes much deeper.  For many environmental activists, this degradation of reflects a fundamental flaw that is deeply rooted in our culture.  They identify this flaw as anthropocentrism, or a worldview that assigns to humans and human values the primary place in the cosmic order.  Their proposed solution is to reject this worldview and adopt a new egalitarian vision in which humans and the rest of nature will have equal value.\r\n\r\nThis article agrees with the view that anthropocentrism presents a real problem for our civilization.  However, it takes a much broader approach to this problem that goes beyond the critique of environmentalists.  First, it sees that the source of anthropocentrism lies much deeper than the environmentalists think.  The source is the pattern in human thinking that emerged when early humans began to walk the face of this earth.  Early humans did not see the important role of the process of creation in the way they perceive, interpret, and represent reality.  The article explains the importance of the process of creation in the way we think.  The article sees the source of anthropocentrism in the failure to recognize the importance of the process of creation and in the way this failure affects our thinking.  This failure has resulted in a view of reality that is limited, exclusionary, and ultimately subjective.  This failure has left humans no choice but to view reality through the prism of mental constructs that they create, which is the main source of anthropocentrism.  Also, environmentalists see the problem of anthropocentrism primarily in its relationship to the environment.  This article emphasizes that anthropocentrism is a broad phenomenon that affect many areas of our life.\r\n\r\nFinally, the article examines major solutions that address the problem of anthropocentrism and offers their critique.  It sees their principal common shortcoming in their exclusionary approach and outlines a new and inclusive approach.","primary_category":"General Science and Philosophy","authors":["Gennady Shkliarevsky"],"published":"2021-09-29"}

These varieties are separated from each other due to some of their features. These are usually features such as texture, shape, and color. With these features that distinguish rice varieties, it is possible to classify and evaluate the quality of seeds. In this study, Arborio, Basmati, Ipsala, Jasmine and Karacadag, which are five different varieties of rice often grown in Turkey, were used. A total of 75,000 grain images, 15,000 from each of these varieties, are included in the dataset. A second dataset with 106 features including 12 morphological, 4 shape and 90 color features obtained from these images was used. Models were created by using Artificial Neural Network (ANN) and Deep Neural Network (DNN) algorithms for the feature dataset and by using the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) algorithm for the image dataset, and classification processes were performed. Statistical results of sensitivity, specificity, prediction, F1 score, accuracy, false positive rate and false negative rate were calculated using the confusion matrix values of the models and the results of each model were given in tables. Classification successes from the models were achieved as 99.87% for ANN, 99.95% for DNN and 100% for CNN. With the results, it is seen that the models used in the study in the classification of rice varieties can be applied successfully in this field.","primary_category":"Artificial Intelligence","authors":["Murat Koklu","Ilkay Cinar","Yavuz Selim Taspinar"],"published":"2021-09-28"}

Therefore, the direction of rotation with respect to the direction of travel of the magnetic quantum is opposite each other.\r\n Next, it is assumed that the magnetic quantum that rotates to the right in the direction of travel is the magnetic quantum that is generated from the N pole (N magnetic quantum), and the magnetic quantum that rotates to the left in the direction of travel is the magnetic quantum that is generated from the S pole (S magnetic quantum). And then the generation of magnetic force and the mechanism of action were investigated. As a result, the reason why the magnet exerts a repulsive force on the same magnetic poles and the attractive force acts on different magnetic poles, and the mechanism by which a ferromagnetic material such as iron is attracted to the magnet and the ferromagnetic material itself becomes a magnet were clarified. Therefore the structure and properties of the magnet could be explained theoretically, and the mechanism of generation and action of magnetic force was clarified.","primary_category":"Classical Physics","authors":["Yukihiko Hoshino"],"published":"2021-09-23"}

Different geophysical maps indicate this impact crater on the floor of the Southern Ocean, which I think is a secondary crater of the Permian Triassic Impact Event. \r\nThe best indication comes from a magnetic anomaly map of the ocean floor which shows a precise semi-circular anomaly (see map below). Further indicaten comes from a combination of a gravity anomaly map of Australia and a topographic map of Antarctica. The visible bow-shaped structures indicate an impact crater of up to \u00d8 420 km. \r\nTo provide first evidence for this impact crater I collected rock samples from the linear Fraser Range, which I believe was caused by a massive ejecta ray from this crater ( see maps below ). With a Raman microscope I analysed rock samples which I collected in the Fraser Range. The Raman spectra of quartz grains from the sample sites 50, 52 and 55 provide first indication for a shock event, the impact of an ejecta ray from the Southern Ocean Crater, which probably formed the Fraser Range. The shifts of two main Raman peaks of the analysed quartz grains from sample site 55 (Stone 1) to the lower frequencies 263 and 205 cm-1 and to 261\/264 and 205 cm-1, and the shifts of two main Raman peaks in the quartz grains from sample site 50 (Stone 2) to the lower frequencies  204 and 124 cm-1 and to 260\/265 and 204 (200,209) cm-1 ( double peaks ), and similar shifts in samples from site 52, which are visible in the Raman Spectra provide a first indication that the quartz from these sample sites was exposed to a shock pressure in the range of  20 - 22 GPa.

The Dirichlet eta function(DEF) \u03b7(s) is modification of RZF. In this thesis, we treat each term of RZF and DEF as a vector. From the geometric properties of vectors, we got clues of proof from the fact that, in a complex variable s = \u03b1 + i\u03b2, \u03b1 only affects the magnitude of each vector and \u03b2 affects only the argument of each vector, independently. So, each vector with same n are parallel to each other, regardless of the value of \u03b1. This parallel property implies a very strict geometric restriction which lead to two successful proofs of Riemann Hypothesis(RH). One proof is from the contradictions which come from the trajectories of RZF, and the other proof is by applying Chauchy integral theorem to the trajectory of RZF. We tried to provide sufficient graphs and videos for the understanding of the vector geometry properties of RZF and DEF. In appendix, we provided the source programs for analyzing vectors and suggested two other possible proofs of RH for further studies.","primary_category":"Number Theory","authors":["Tae Beom Lee"],"published":"2021-09-15"}

In the present contribution a varied quartic polynomial contrasting the polynomial used by Planat et al. is proposed that considered apart from the golden mean also the fifth power of this dominant number of nature to adapt the code information. The suggested polynomial is denoted as \u3016g(x)=x\u3017^4-x^3-(4\u3016-\u03c6^2)x\u3017^2+(4-\u03c6^2)x+1, where \u03c6=(\u221a5-1)\/2 is the golden mean.

The latter spins $ J$ belong to the Regge trajectories in the $ t, u$ channels which are defined by \r\n$   - J  (t) = - 1 - { 1\\over 2 } t  =  \\beta (t)= { 1\\over 2 } + i \\lambda $;   $  - J (u)  =  - 1  - { 1\\over 2 } u =  \\gamma (u) = { 1\\over 2 } - i \\lambda $, with $ \\lambda = real$.

The presently accepted alpha cluster model is inadequate for the explanation of the formation of Li, Be, B, their stability and abundance. Problem of Beryllium bottleneck and the explanation of Hoyle\u2019s state of 12C appear to be insurmountable by this model. \r\nThe combination of a proton and a neutron can produce in addition to deuteron, a particle of zero spin satisfying Pauli Exclusion Principle which is capable of combining with another such unit to produce an alpha particle. This distinctive pair (p \u2013 n) is in reality an isomer of deuteron. The corresponding element is an isotope of hydrogen (hitherto unrecognized) and Christianized as Paulium, (symbol Pl) in honour Wolfgang Pauli. The nucleon of Paulium is Paulion that produces alpha particles and can subsequently take part in numerous neucleosynthetic processes with success. \r\nThe Paulion condensation model can be applied to build-up different isotopes of Li, Be, B, C, N and O and can resolve the hitherto unsolved puzzle in the nucleosynthsis of stable 12C. It can also explain the abundance and the properties of different nuclei.\r\nAn empirical equation A = Z (p \u2013 n) pair + (A - 2Z) N explains the composition of different nuclei where A is the mass of isotope of the nucleus, Z and N being its number of proton and neutron, respectively.","primary_category":"Nuclear and Atomic Physics","authors":["Bijon Kumar Sen"],"published":"2021-09-10"}

The crater is visible on the Magnetic Intensity Map as a precise elliptical structure. This elliptical  ring structure indicates an oblique impact crater. This means the impactor arrived in a very shallow angle of probably < 10\u00b0. \r\nThe orientation of the elliptical ring structure corresponds to the orientation of the assumed ejecta blanket. The age of the oblique impact in all probability is 252 Ma. ( PT-boundary age ). The red- and pink colored rock types on the geological map, which present ejecta of the crater, formed 230-250 Ma ago !\r\nThe impact direction of the elliptical Warwick Crater points towards the Cape York Crater (-chain ). Therefore the \u00d8 8 x 7 km Warwick Crater probably was caused by a large ejecta fragment of the Cape York Impact Event.  I have analysed some rock samples which I have collected inside the \u00d8 8 x 7 km elliptical Warwick Crater.\r\nThe Raman spectrum of quartz from sample site 43 provides first evidence for an impact shock event as the probable cause of the elliptical ring structure of the Warwick Crater. The shifts of the main Raman peaks, of the analysed quartz, to the lower frequencies 463 and 204 cm-1, provide indication for an impact shock event that caused a shock pressure of around 22 GPa.\r\nFurther indication comes from the Raman spectra of quartz grains from sample site 53 which show shifts of the main Raman peaks to the lower frequencies 263 and 205 ( 204 ) cm-1 , and from Raman spectra of  sample site 51 and 54, which show shifts of the main Raman peaks of the analysed quartz grains to the lower frequencies 263 and 205 cm-1 , to 260 and 126 cm-1 and to 262 (265) and 204 (207) cm-1, indicating a shock pressure of 20-22 GPa.\r\nMicroscopic images of some of the analysed quartz grains may provide further proof for a shock event ( see pages :  7, 11, 12 and 22 ).\r\nAll spectra were made with a BRUKER Senterra-II Raman Microscope (wavenumber precision <0.1cm-1).

Traditional learning is a complex process as learning patterns, approach, skills and performance\r\nvaries from person to person. Adaptive online learning focuses on understanding the learner\u2019s\r\nperformance, skills and adapts to it. The use of advanced technology also provides a means to analyse\r\nthe behavioural learning pattern. As it provides the detailed skill mapping and performance which\r\nenables the learner to understand the areas needs to be improved. The information can also be used by\r\nassessors to improve the teaching approach. Advanced online learning system using artificial\r\nintelligence is an emerging concept in the coming years. In this new concept, the classes are not taken\r\nface-to-face in a classroom but through an electronic medium as a substitute. These virtual learning\r\napproach are gaining importance every day and very soon they are going to be an integral part of our\r\nworld. Taking up these virtual learning through an electronic medium is termed as online learning. We\r\nproposed two new models which are powered by artificial intelligence (AI) tools. A number of examples\r\nof using these new models are presented.","primary_category":"Artificial Intelligence","authors":["Yew Kee Wong"],"published":"2021-09-09"}

Such a conception allows not only to clear essentially a number of metaphysical and epistemological problems in philosophy but, besides, allows to suggest a reasonable physical model. Since Matter in Universe is an informational system where every interaction between Matter\u2019s sub-structures, i.e. \u2013 particles and systems of the particles \u2013 happens always as an exchange by exclusively true information between   these structures, the model is based on the conjecture that Matter is some analogue of computer. This conjecture, in turn, allows to introduce in the model the basic logical elements that constitute the material structures and support the informational exchange - i.e. interactions - between the structures.  The model is experimentally testable and yet now makes be more clear a number of basic problems in special relativity, quantum mechanics, and, rather probably, in [now \u2013 in Newtonian] gravity.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Sergey V.

{"vixra_id":"2109.0042","title":"Is the Higgs Field a Positive and Negative Mass Planckion Condensate, and Does the LHC Produce Extreme Dark Energy?","abstract":"Assuming a two component, positive and negative mass, superfluid\/supersolid for space (the Winterberg model), we model the Higgs field as a condensate made up of a positive and a negative mass, planckion pair.  The connection is shown to be consistent (compatible) with the underlying field equations for each field, and the continuity equation is satisfied for both species of planckions, as well as for the Higgs field.  An inherent length scale for space (the vacuum) emerges, which we estimate from previous work to be of the order of,  l_+ (0)=l_- (0)=5.032 E-19 meters, for an undisturbed (unperturbed) vacuum.  Thus we assume a lattice structure for space, made up of overlapping positive and negative mass wave functions, \u03c8_+ , and, \u03c8_- , which together bind to form the Higgs field, giving it its rest mass of 125.35 Gev\/c^2 with a coherence length equal to its Compton wavelength.  If the vacuum experiences an extreme disturbance, such as in a LHC pp \u0305 collision, it is conjectured that severe dark energy results, on a localized level, with a partial disintegration of the Higgs force field in the surrounding space.  The Higgs boson as a quantum excitation in this field results when the vacuum reestablishes itself, within \u301610\u3017^(-22) seconds, with positive and negative planckion mass number densities equalizing in the disturbed region.  Using our fundamental equation relating the Higgs field, \u03c6, to the planckion \u03c8_+and \u03c8_-wave functions, we calculate the overall vacuum pressure (equal to vacuum energy density), as well as typical \u03c8_+ and \u03c8_- displacements from equilibrium within the vacuum.","primary_category":"High Energy Particle Physics","authors":["Christopher Pilot"],"published":"2021-09-06"}

{"vixra_id":"2109.0037","title":"Black Hole Information Concealed in Gravitational Waves","abstract":"The black hole information paradox is a contradiction between quantum mechanics and general relativity. Information in the form of matter and energy , which enters the black hole can never escape due to the extreme gravitational curvature of space-time, while at the same time the black hole slowly evaporates through the Hawking radiation due to virtual pairs generated at the surface of the event horizon. This collision of the uncertainty principle of quantum mechanics with the extreme gravitation predicted by general relativity can generate new ideas regarding the behavior of space-time. This paper suggests that information can escape from the black hole gravitational grip, in the form of  gravitational waves, as they ripple the fabric of space time.A black hole is an extreme case in which the curvature of space time transforms the information concealed in matter and energy into a sequence of ripples in the fabric of space time. The black hole is also a unique case in which the extreme curvature transforms virtual particles in the vacuum to radiation (Hawking radiation) as it slowly evaporates . These ripples in space time can influence the Hawking radiation in a way that it will radiate, together with the gravitational waves, the concealed information from the black hole singularity back to outer space.","primary_category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["Eran Sinbar"],"published":"2021-09-06"}

{"vixra_id":"2109.0028","title":"Dynamic Latent Scale GAN","abstract":"Generator of generative adversarial networks (GAN) maps latent random variable into data random variable. GAN inversion is mapping data random variable to latent random variable by inverting the generator of GAN. \r\n When training the encoder for generator inversion, using the mean squared error causes the encoder to not converge because there is information loss on the latent random variable in the generator. In other words, it is impossible to train an encoder that inverts the generator as it, because the generator may ignore some information of the latent random variable.\r\n This paper introduces a dynamic latent scale GAN, a method for training a generator that does not lose information from the latent random variable, and an encoder that inverts the generator. When the latent random variable is a normal i.i.d. (independent and identically distributed) random variable, dynamic latent scale GAN dynamically scales each element of the latent random variable during GAN training to adjust the entropy of the latent random variable. As training progresses, the entropy of the latent random variable decreases until there is no information loss on the latent random variable in the generator. If there is no information loss on the latent random variable in the generator, the encoder can converge to invert the generator.\r\n The scale of the latent random variable depends on the amount of information that the encoder can recover. It can be calculated from the element-wise variance of the predicted latent random variable from the encoder.\r\n Since the scale of latent random variable changes dynamically in dynamic latent scale GAN, the encoder should be trained with a generator during GAN training. The encoder can be integrated with the discriminator, and the loss for the encoder is added to the generator loss for fast training.","primary_category":"Artificial Intelligence","authors":["Jeongik Cho"],"published":"2021-09-16"}

One of the great questions in cosmology\u2014along with what is the \u2018dark energy\u2019 and the other cosmic anomalies\u2014is whether the universe is also fractal? The 2012 WiggleZ Dark Energy Survey found, in agreement with fractal-cosmology proponents, the small-scale observable universe is fractal, the large-scale is not fractal. Fractals have not been modelled from the perspective of being within a growing one. Can a (different) fractal model explain all cosmological observations and conjectures, and if so, are we are modelling the fractal universe incorrectly? An experiment was conducted on a \u2018simple\u2019 (Koch snowflake) fractal, testing the perspective of an in-situ observer within a growing\/emergent fractal \u2014 \u2018looking back\u2019 in iteration-time to its origin. New triangle sizes were held constant allowing earlier triangles in the set to expand as the set iterated. Classical kinematic equations of velocities and accelerations were calculated for the total area total and the distance between points. Hubble-Lemaitre's Law and other cosmological observations and conjectures were tested for. Results showed area(s) expanded exponentially from an arbitrary starting position; and as a consequence, the distances between points \u2014 from any location within the set \u2014 receded away from the \u2018observer\u2019 at increasing velocities and accelerations. It was concluded, at the expense of the cosmological principle, that the fractal is a geometrical match to the cosmological problems, including the inflation epoch, Hubble-Lemaitre and accelerated expansion; inhomogeneous (fractal) galaxy distribution on the small and homogenous on large scales; and other problems \u2014 including the cosmological catastrophe. The fractal may offer a direct mechanism to the cosmological problem and can further explain the quantum problem \u2014 unifying the two realities as being two aspects of the same geometry.","primary_category":"Astrophysics","authors":["Blair D.

This subject is an unsolved problem in physics and naval architecture, even though the buoyancy taught by Archimedes' principle can be obtained clearly by the surface integral of hydrostatic pressure.  Then we thought that the reason why the vertical position of the center of pressure could not be determined was that the horizontal force would be zero due to equilibrium in the upright state.\r\n   As a breakthrough, we dared to assume the left-right asymmetric pressure field by inclining the ship.  In that state, the force and moment due to hydrostatic pressure were calculated correctly with respect to the tilted coordinate system fixed to the floating body.  By doing so, we succeeded in determining the center of pressure.\r\n   Then, by setting the heel angle to zero, it was proved that the center of hydrostatic pressure is equal to the well-known center of buoyancy, i.e., the centroid of the cross-sectional area under the water surface.\r\n   Specifically, the above proof is first shown for a rectangular cross-section, and then for an arbitrary shape of floating body by applying Gauss's integral theorem.","primary_category":"Classical Physics","authors":["Tsutomu Hori"],"published":"2021-09-15"}

Rather, in much modern times, when humans have developed the natural insights and prorated those in the form of a much more logically biased discovery, then, the atheists have started to dominate the scientific arena for their foreplay in the work of their discoveries. However, as time passes by, five special types of research communities have gathered to allocate their discovered data\u2019s in the respective norms as such, i) Atheists to whom, there is in essence no God and nothing in this universe can be attributed to them. ii) Believer of only one God as a whole, where the principle of religious biasing is effluent and supreme in their regards of the physical laws associated with the life and stimuli, iii) Believer of multiple God\u2019s as a whole which poses no such scientific evaluation but can be thought of as a conjugate mechanism for the creator of the universe, iv) A divine supreme, where there is exactly no God, but the whole universe is a manifestation of the nature, where nature indirectly focuses the presence of God\u2019s or the supreme creator that maintains symmetry and working of the universe, v)  The not-so-sure about mechanism of the God\u2019s presence, where the researcher sometimes tends to belief in God when something magical happens and attribute all to their divine grace, or in times of failures where they accused them for not being philosophically intrinsic as to their own needs, and in times with the believe that, \u2018we won\u2019t believe what we can\u2019t see!\u2019, either in the middle of the good or bad moments or in general in a casual and carefree mode.
