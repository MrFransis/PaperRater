This proposition does not challenge Local Lorentz Invariance, a characteristic of space-time which is properly studied in vacuum, but instead suggests an unconventional effect in low density matter. A rotating Mach-Zehnder interferometer comparing propagation of 532 nm laser light in air and vacuum demonstrated the one-way speed of light in air to be isotropic to the level of delta c\/c < 1E-9. This result excludes anisotropic propagation matching a classical \u201cether drift\u201d pattern as an explanation for Miller\u2019s (1933) data.

{"vixra_id":"2112.0016","title":"The Projection Theory Part I Supplement 1: A New Definition of Time & the Calculation of the Speed of Light Based on the Electron Radius","abstract":"In the summary of the 1main part of this work it was stated that all physical constants investigated there, like G, \u03bc0 \u03b50 or \u03b1 can be represented over only three basic values, i.e., a minimum length smin, minimum time tmin and the radius of the electron re, as well as additionally the dimension factors fD4 and fD42 worked out especially for the projection theory. With this supplementary work, we have now succeeded in reducing the number of basic values to a single one, namely re, since the other two can be derived quite easily from this quantity.                                                                                                                               The minimum length smin, which was previously calculated via h and therefore corresponded from the value of the Compton wavelength for the proton, is now replaced by smin = re 2\u03c02.                  The values of smin old and new have a relative deviation of 1.6 10-6, which is acceptable, but still subject to further consideration.                                                                                                         For the conversion of tmin to a re-based expression, one must remember the important principle of projection theory that time in our projective reality corresponds to a length in the 4th dimension. A length in the third dimension can be transformed into a four-dimensional one simply by applying the power 4\/3. It was postulated therefore for our basic values: re4\/3 \u2261 tmin                             re4\/3 = ftime tmin The task was to calculate the proportionality constant ftime in a simple and independent way. In fact, this was accomplished in three ways. The first formula is based exclusively on \u03c0 and the above-mentioned dimension factors. The second equation is a pure number construct, i.e., a geometrical series which contains only powers of ten and the factor 60 which is important for our time calculation. The third formula derives in the basic structure from the second one, but contains the important conversion factors of our time division system (1440 min\/d, 86400 s\/d) and a time reference from cosmology, the sidereal year in sidereal days. With these proportionality constants, the speed of light could be calculated with a relative error of 2 10-7, 1 10-9 and 5 10-11 in the order of the above enumeration of the factors.","category":"Classical Physics","authors":["Norbert Buchholz"],"published":"2021-12-03"}

{"vixra_id":"2112.0010","title":"Com Quantum Laws of LIGO Signal","abstract":"The academic circles over publicize the difficult process of LIGO exploring the signal and extracting the signal according to the predetermined target, which not only exposes the essence that such so-called scientific experiments are more like secret children's play, but also makes readers' attention far deviate from the important theme of how to use scientific methods to test whether LIGO signal is the gravitational wave generated in the process of spiral binary star merger, so as to blindly believe in science fiction news. What exact law should gravitational waves obey? Since LIGO gives the so-called observation data of gw150914 signal, as long as the accurate law obeyed by gw150914 signal is analyzed and compared with the accurate law of gravitational wave, an irrefutable scientific conclusion can be obtained. In fact, the gw150914 signal does not follow the relativistic Blanchet frequency equation of gravitational waves that LIGO likes to talk about (please refer to the paper: relativistic equation failure for LIGO signals). It has a unique law and seems to be a signal on the earth. However, further analysis shows that it has some specific differences from such signals on the earth. The comprehensive conclusion from multiple perspectives shows that the key operators of LIGO secretly extract data of the motion process of the simulation device to confuse the public and thus forge gw150914 gravitational wave, which is very likely. This paper accurately fits the com quantum law obeyed by gw150914 signal frequency. However, almost all famous mainstream academic journals unanimously refuse to publish such papers on the accurate analysis of the precise law of LIGO signal, and continue to publish more science fiction stories without experimental data analysis to further maintain lies. The author now offers a reward of 1 million yuan to reward scholars who strictly deduce the accurate co quantization law of gw150914 signal in theory rather than guessing through hypothesis. People who pursue truth all over the world unite to prevent the further spread of mainstream academic corruption that ignores academic morality, only seeks fame and wealth, cooperates in fraud and stifles truth. This reward is valid before the author publishes the core principles of COM quantum theory and is limited to the author's lifetime.","category":"Quantum Physics","authors":["X. D.

{"vixra_id":"2112.0001","title":"Our Collapsing Friedman Universe","abstract":"In 1907 using special relativity, Albert Einstein proved that vacuum permittivity, \u03b5, changes in accelerating coordinate reference frames. \u03b5 is the scalar in Maxwell\u2019s equations that determines the speed of light and the strength of electrical fields. In 1952, M\u00f8ller confirmed Einstein\u2019s discovery by proving that \u03b5 is a function of the curvature of static spacetimes. In 1994, Sumner proved that \u03b5 changes with the curvature of Friedmann spacetime. Photon energies are proportional to \u03b5, but the energies of photons emitted by atoms are proportional to \u03b5^2. This difference reverses the interpretation of Hubble redshifts. Hubble redshifts only result when a Friedmann universe is collapsing. This is confirmed by the Pantheon redshift data fit of 1048 supernovas with a negative Hubble constant Ho =-72.10\u00b10.75 km s\u22121 Mpc\u22121 and a deceleration parameter 1\/2 < q_o < 0.51. The velocity of light in Friedmann geometry is inversely proportional to the radius of the universe. The velocity of light was infinite at the Big Bang and decreased to zero at maximum size when the universe began to collapse. The velocity of light is now accelerating towards infinity. Its current value is c. Collapse will be complete in 9.05 billion years. The current age of the universe is estimated to be 1.54 x 10^4 billion years.","category":"Relativity and Cosmology","authors":["William Q. Sumner"],"published":"2021-12-01"}
