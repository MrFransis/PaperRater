{"arxiv_id":"2112.00451","title":"Unconditional well-posedness and IMEX improvement of a family of predictor-corrector methods in micromagnetics","abstract":"Recently, Kim & Wilkening (Convergence of a mass-lumped finite element method\nfor the Landau-Lifshitz equation, Quart.

Both integrators are based on the\nso-called Landau-Lifshitz form of LLG, use mass-lumped variational formulations\ndiscretized by first-order finite elements, and only require the solution of\nlinear systems, despite the nonlinearity of LLG. The first(-order in time)\nmethod combines a linear update with an explicit projection of an intermediate\napproximation onto the unit sphere in order to fulfill the LLG-inherent\nunit-length constraint at the discrete level. In the second(-order in time)\nintegrator, the projection step is replaced by a linear constraint-preserving\nvariational formulation. In this paper, we extend the analysis of the\nintegrators by proving unconditional well-posedness and by establishing a close\nconnection of the methods with other approaches available in the literature.\nMoreover, the new analysis also provides a well-posed integrator for the\nSchr\\\"odinger map equation (which is the limit case of LLG for vanishing\ndamping). Finally, we design an implicit-explicit strategy for the treatment of\nthe lower-order field contributions, which significantly reduces the\ncomputational cost of the schemes, while preserving their theoretical\nproperties.","category":"math.NA","categories":["math.NA","cs.NA","35K61, 65M12, 65M22, 65M60, 65Z05"],"authors":["Norbert J.

(If\nthe DM-nucleon interaction is attractive and bound states can be formed, most\nDM bind to nuclei and the density is much lower.)\n  Neufeld and Brach-Neufeld performed experiments to constrain the DM-baryon\nscattering cross section of DM atmosphere around Earth, by measuring the\nevaporation rate of liquid nitrogen in a storage dewar within which various\nmaterials are immersed. If the DM-nitrogen cross section is in an appropriate\nrange, room temperature DM would penetrate the dewar walls and scatter on the\ncold nitrogen, increasing its evaporation rate beyond the observed level.\nLimits on the cross section of DM with other materials than nitrogen are\nobtained by adding known amounts of different materials; if the material is\nheated by interactions with DM, that heats and evaporates the liquid nitrogen.\n  Because Born approximation is in general invalid in much of the relevant\ncross section regime, it is non-trivial to interpret such experimental results\nas a limit on the DM-nucleon cross section. In this paper we derive the\nconstraints on DM-baryon scattering, with the interaction modeled as a Yukawa\npotential sourced by the finite sized nucleus.

Modern multi-dimensional simulations of SNe demonstrate\ndevelopment of hydrodynamical instabilities during the explosion phase. But the\nconfiguration of a star and inhomogeneities prior to explosion could strongly\naffect how the SNe develops. In a number of papers on numerical modeling of\npair-instability supernovae explosion (PISNe) considered the case when\nthermonuclear energy in the central region of a massive star is introduced by\nthe series of several hot spots.

An observable manifestation of\nthis may be the presence of peaks on light curves of gamma-ray burst associated\nwith explosions of massive stars.\n  The physical nature of such inhomogeneities is not evident and the number and\nsize of spots is a conjecture. In this work, we study the possibility of\nformation of these inhomogeneities at the stage of the core-collapse (CC) in a\nmassive star. To check this assumption, we chose analytic self-similar model of\nCC and investigated stability of solutions obtained from it with respect to\nsmall multidimensional perturbations.

This led to\nformulate the \\textit{central hypothesis of irreversibility} stating that the\ntime-scale of decoherence, $T_3$, is proportional to the time-scale of the\nmany-body interactions we reversed, $T_2$. We test this by implementing two\nexperimental schemes based on Floquet Hamiltonians where the effective strength\nof the dipolar spin-spin coupling, i.e. $1\/T_2$, is reduced by a variable scale\nfactor $k$. This extends the perturbations time scale, $T_\\Sigma$, in relation\nto $T_2$. Strikingly, we observe the superposition of the normalized Loschmidt\nechoes for the bigger values of $k$. This manifests the dominance of the\nintrinsic dynamics over the perturbation factors, even when the Loschmidt echo\nis devised to reverse that intrinsic dynamics. Thus, in the limit where the\nreversible interactions dominate over perturbations, the LE decays within a\ntime-scale, $T_3\\approx T_2\/R$ with $R=(0.15 \\pm 0.01)$, confirming the\nemergence of a perturbation independent regime. These results support the\ncentral hypothesis of irreversibility.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph","cond-mat.stat-mech"],"authors":["Claudia M.

As a result, forward modeling errors are inevitable. In\npractice, such model errors tend to be either completely ignored, which leads\nto biased and over-confident inversion results, or only partly taken into\naccount using restrictive Gaussian assumptions. Here, we rely on deep\ngenerative neural networks to learn problem-specific low-dimensional\nprobabilistic representations of the discrepancy between high-fidelity and\nlow-fidelity forward solvers. These representations are then used to\nprobabilistically invert for the model error jointly with the target\ngeophysical property field, using the computationally-cheap, low-fidelity\nforward solver. To this end, we combine a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)\ninversion algorithm with a trained convolutional neural network of the spatial\ngenerative adversarial network (SGAN) type, whereby at each MCMC step, the\nsimulated low-fidelity forward response is corrected using a proposed\nmodel-error realization.

In this paper, we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine\nthe full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its associated conservation laws in\nHorava gravity.

A\npre-processing procedure is applied first, including a derivative approach and\na PCA-based correction mask, to eliminate common central artifacts (i.e.,\napex-centered column saturation artifact and posterior stromal artifact) and\nenable standardized analysis.

This phenomenon has become increasingly\npivotal in clarifying the pairing 'enigma' particularly for multiband\nhigh-temperature superconductors. In one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe\/SrTiO3, the\nthinnest and highest-Tc member of iron-based superconductors, the standard\nelectron-hole Fermi pocket nesting scenario is apparently not applicable since\nthe Gamma-centered hole pockets are absent, so the actual pairing mechanism is\nthe subject of intense debate. Here, by measuring high-resolution Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle interference, we report observations of highly anisotropic\nmagnetic Cooper pairing in 1-UC FeSe. From a theoretical point of view, it is\nimportant to incorporate effects of electronic correlations within a\nspin-fluctuation pairing calculation, where the dxy orbital becomes\ncoherence-suppressed. The resulting pairing gap is compatible with the\nexperimental findings, which suggests that high-Tc Cooper pairing with orbital\nselectivity applies to 1-UC FeSe. Our findings imply the general existence of\norbital selectivity in iron-based superconductors and the universal importance\nof electron correlations in high-Tc superconductors.","category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":["cond-mat.supr-con","cond-mat.mes-hall","cond-mat.mtrl-sci","cond-mat.str-el"],"authors":["Chaofei Liu","Andreas Kreisel","Shan Zhong","Yu Li","Brian M.

A feedforward neural\nnetwork with two individual loss groups are constructed to encode the initial\ncondition and state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) in MSS. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitude\nof the back-propagated gradients in PINN from a multi-task learning\nperspective.

These currents enhance\nground magnetic field perturbations (d$B$\/d$t$), which in turn generate\ngeomagnetically induced currents (GICs) that can be detrimental to power\ntransmission infrastructure. We perform a comparative study of d$B$\/d$t$\nvariations in response to two similarly strong shocks, but with one being\nnearly frontal, and the other, highly inclined. Multi-instrument analyses by\nthe Time History of Events and Macroscale Interactions during Substorms\n(THEMIS) and Los Alamos National Laboratory spacecraft show that nightside\nsubstorm-time energetic particle injections are more intense and occur faster\nin the case of the nearly head-on impact. The same trend is observed in\nd$B$\/d$t$ variations recorded by THEMIS ground magnetometers. THEMIS all-sky\nimager data show a fast and clear poleward auroral expansion in the first case,\nwhich does not clearly occur in the second case. Strong field-aligned currents\ncomputed with the spherical elementary current system (SECS) technique occur in\nboth cases, but the current variations resulting from the inclined shock impact\nare weaker and slower compared to the nearly frontal case. SECS analyses also\nreveal that geographic areas with d$B$\/d$t$ surpassing the thresholds 1.5 and 5\nnT\/s, usually linked to high-risk GICs, are larger and occur earlier due to the\nsymmetric compression caused by the nearly head-on impact.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.00039","title":"Non-perturbative analytical diagonalization of Hamiltonians with application to ZZ-coupling suppression and enhancement","abstract":"Deriving effective Hamiltonian models plays an essential role in quantum\ntheory, with particular emphasis in recent years on control and engineering\nproblems. In this work, we present two symbolic methods for computing effective\nHamiltonian models: the Non-perturbative Analytical Diagonalization (NPAD) and\nthe Recursive Schrieffer-Wolff Transformation (RSWT). NPAD makes use of the\nJacobi iteration and works without the assumptions of perturbation theory while\nretaining convergence, allowing to treat a very wide range of models. In the\nperturbation regime, it reduces to RSWT, which takes advantage of an in-built\nrecursive structure where remarkably the number of terms increases only\nlinearly with perturbation order, exponentially decreasing the number of terms\ncompared to the ubiquitous Schrieffer-Wolff method. Both methods consist of\nelementary algebra and can be easily automated to obtain closed-form\nexpressions. To demonstrate the application of the methods, we study the ZZ\ninteraction of superconducting qubits systems in two different parameter\nregimes. In the near-resonant regime, the method produces an analytical\nexpression for the effective ZZ interaction strength, with an improvement of at\nleast one order of magnitude compared to neglecting the comparably further\ndetuned state. In the dispersive regime, we calculate perturbative corrections\nup to the 8th order and accurately identify a regime where ZZ interaction is\nsuppressed in a simple model with only resonator-mediated coupling.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph"],"authors":["Boxi Li","Tommaso Calarco","Felix Motzoi"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}

All the previous results are generalised to this case. We then\nintroduce some 2 and 3 dimensional symmetry algebras of the Kinetic energy\n(Killing vectors), which restrict the conformal factor. This enables us to\nreduce our systems from 3 to 2 degrees of freedom, giving rise to many\ninteresting systems, including both Kepler type and H\\'enon-Heiles type\npotentials on a Darboux-Koenigs $D_2$ background.","category":"nlin.SI","categories":["nlin.SI","math-ph","math.MP","17B63, 37J15, 37J35, 70G45, 70G65, 70H06"],"authors":["Allan P.

For filling factor $\\nu_G=-2+5\/3$\nthere is a parent state in the $SU(4)$ limit which has a flavor content\n$(1,1\/3,1\/3,0)$ where the two components that are one-third filled form a\ntwo-component singlet. The addition of anisotropies leads to the formation of\nnew states that have no counterpart at $\\nu_G=0$. While some of them are\npredicted by the variational approach, we find notably that negative Ising-like\nvalley anisotropy leads to the formation of a state which is a singlet in both\nspin and valley space and lies beyond the reach of the variational method. Also\nfully spin polarized two-component states at $\\nu=-2+4\/3$ and $\\nu=-2+5\/3$\ndisplay an emergent $SU(2)$ valley symmetry because they do not feel\npoint-contact anisotropies. We discuss implications for current experiments\nconcerning possible spin transitions.","category":"cond-mat.mes-hall","categories":["cond-mat.mes-hall","cond-mat.str-el"],"authors":["Ngoc Duc Le","Thierry Jolicoeur"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}

On the other hand, the absolute magnitude of\nsupernovae of Type Ia (SNIa), $M$, is pivotal to infer the distances to these\nstandard candles. Having access to (at least) one of these two quantities is\ncrucial to measure the Hubble parameter $H_0$ from BAO\/SNIa data. In this work\nwe present a new method to measure how long is the cosmic ruler and how bright\nare the standard candles independently from the main drivers of the $H_0$\ntension, namely by avoiding (i) the use of CMB data; (ii) the calibration of\nSNIa in the first steps of the cosmic distance ladder; and (iii) the assumption\nof any concrete cosmological model. We only assume that SNIa can be safely\nemployed as standard candles and $r_d$ as a standard ruler, together with the\nvalidity of the Cosmological Principle and the metric description of gravity,\nwith photons propagating in null geodesics and the conservation of the photon\nnumber.

In this context, the present work relies on\nhighly-accurate \\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ vertical transition energies for 284 excited\nstates of diverse character determined in 35 small- to medium-sized organic\nmolecules containing from three to six non-hydrogen atoms to assess the\nperformances of these approaches.

In the analysis of stellar spectra, the\nnumerical model often needs to account for binary companions and 3D structures\nin the stellar envelopes. The enigmatic binary (or multiple) system LB-1\nconstitutes a perfect example of such a complex multi-D problem. Aims: To\nimprove our understanding of the LB-1 system, we directly modelled the\nphase-dependent H-alpha line profiles of this system. To this end, we developed\na multi-purpose binary-object spectral-synthesis code in 3D (BOSS-3D). Methods:\nBOSS-3D calculates synthetic line profiles for a given state of the\ncircumstellar material. The standard pz-geometry commonly used for single stars\nis extended by defining individual coordinate systems for each involved object\nand by accounting for the appropriate coordinate transformations. The code is\nthen applied to the LB-1 system, considering two main hypotheses, a binary\ncontaining a stripped star and Be star, or a B star and a black hole with a\ndisc. Results: Comparing these two scenarios, neither model can reproduce the\ndetailed phase-dependent shape of the H-alpha line profiles. A satisfactory\nmatch with the observations, however, is obtained by invoking a disc around the\nprimary object in addition to the Be-star disc or the black-hole accretion\ndisc. Conclusions: The developed code can be used to model synthetic line\nprofiles for a wide variety of binary systems, ranging from transit spectra of\nplanetary atmospheres, to post-asymptotic giant branch binaries including\ncircumstellar and circumbinary discs and massive-star binaries with stellar\nwinds and disc systems.

There has been progress on\nlarge-scale dynamical effects and on 1D convection parameterization, but\nresolved 3D moist convection remains unexplored in non-dilute conditions,\nthough it can have a profound impact on temperature\/humidity profiles and cloud\nstructure. We tackle this problem for pure-steam atmospheres using\nthree-dimensional, high-resolution numerical simulations of convection in\npost-runaway atmospheres where the water reservoir at the surface has been\nexhausted. We show that the atmosphere is comprised of two characteristic\nregions, an upper condensing region dominated by gravity waves and a lower\nnoncondensing region characterized by convective overturning cells. Velocities\nin the condensing region are much smaller than those in the lower noncondensing\nregion, and the horizontal temperature variation is small overall. Condensation\nin the thermal photosphere is largely driven by radiative cooling and tends to\nbe statistically homogeneous. Some condensation also happens deeper, near the\nboundary of the condensing region, due to triggering by gravity waves and\nconvective penetrations and exhibit random patchiness. This qualitative\nstructure is insensitive to varying model parameters, but quantitative details\nmay differ.

However, LIBS mapping data have two\npeculiarities: an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio due to single-shot\nmeasurements, and a high dimensionality due to the high number of spectra\nacquired for imaging. This is all the truer as lateral resolution gets higher:\nin this case, the ablation spot diameter is reduced, as well as the ablated\nmass and the emission signal, while the number of spectra for a given surface\nincreases. Therefore, efficient extraction of physico-chemical information from\na noisy and large dataset is a major issue. Multivariate approaches were\nintroduced by several authors as a means to cope with such data, particularly\nPrincipal Component Analysis. Yet, PCA is known to present theoretical\nconstraints for the consistent reconstruction of the dataset, and has therefore\nlimitations to efficient interpretation of LIBS mapping data. In this paper, we\nintroduce HyperPCA, a new analysis tool for hyperspectral images based on a\nsparse representation of the data using Discrete Wavelet Transform and\nkernel-based sparse PCA to reduce the impact of noise on the data and to\nconsistently reconstruct the spectroscopic signal, with a particular emphasis\non LIBS data.

Performing an\nanalytic continuation to the complex $s$-plane, we find no evidence of a pole\ncorresponding to the broad resonance $X(3860)$ reported by the Belle\nCollaboration. Instead, we find a clear bound state below the $D\\bar{D}$\nthreshold at $\\sqrt{s_B} = 3695(4)$ MeV, confirming the previous\nphenomenological and lattice predictions.","category":"hep-ph","categories":["hep-ph"],"authors":["Oleksandra Deineka","Igor Danilkin","Marc Vanderhaeghen"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}
{"arxiv_id":"2111.15032","title":"Gravitational collapse of spherical shells of fluid in the isotropic homogeneous universe","abstract":"We investigate gravitational collapse of thick shells of fluid in the\nisotropic homogeneous universe without radiation described by the Einstein\ngravity with cosmological constant. After determining the scale factor for a\nperfect fluid coexisting with cosmological constant, we determine the orbit of\nthe collapsing or blowing shells of fluid from the continuity condition for\ndensity and the perpendicular component of pressure at interface. However the\ncontinuity condition cannot fix the orbit when there does not exist a perfect\nfluid inside the shells.In this case we determine the orbit from an equation of\nstate for the fluid consisting a shell near the surface. Finally we confirm\nthat the total energy defined in arXiv:2005.13233 is independent of the given\ntime evolution in this system.","category":"gr-qc","categories":["gr-qc","astro-ph.CO","hep-ph","hep-th"],"authors":["Shuichi Yokoyama"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}
{"arxiv_id":"2112.00240","title":"Measurements of Proton High Order Cumulants in $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 3 GeV Au+Au Collisions and Implications for the QCD Critical Point","abstract":"We report cumulants of the proton multiplicity distribution from dedicated\nfixed-target Au+Au collisions at $\\sqrt{s_{_{\\mathrm{NN}}}}$ = 3.0 GeV,\nmeasured by the STAR experiment in the kinematic acceptance of rapidity ($y$)\nand transverse momentum ($p_{\\rm T}$) within $-0.5 < y<0$ and $0.4 < p_{\\rm T}\n<2.0 $ GeV\/$c$. In the most central 0--5\\% collisions, a proton cumulant ratio\nis measured to be $C_4\/C_2=-0.85 \\pm 0.09 ~(\\rm stat.) \\pm 0.82 ~(\\rm syst.)$,\nwhich is less than unity, the Poisson baseline. The hadronic transport UrQMD\nmodel reproduces our $C_4\/C_2$ in the measured acceptance. Compared to higher\nenergy results and the transport model calculations, the suppression in\n$C_4\/C_2$ is consistent with fluctuations driven by baryon number conservation\nand indicates an energy regime dominated by hadronic interactions. These data\nimply that the QCD critical region, if created in heavy-ion collisions, could\nonly exist at energies higher than 3\\,GeV.","category":"nucl-ex","categories":["nucl-ex"],"authors":["STAR Collaboration","M.
