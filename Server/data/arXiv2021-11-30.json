There are five Platonic solids in three dimensions, but there are\nalso solids with Platonic properties (also known as regular polyhedra) in four\nand higher dimensions. The concept of Platonic Bell inequalities in the\nthree-dimensional Euclidean space was introduced by Tavakoli and Gisin [Quantum\n4, 293 (2020)]. For any three-dimensional Platonic solid, an arrangement of\nprojective measurements is associated where the measurement directions point\ntoward the vertices of the solids. For the higher dimensional regular\npolyhedra, we use the correspondence of the vertices to the measurements in the\nabstract Tsirelson space [B. Tsirelson, J. Soviet Math. 36, 557 (1987)]. We\ngive a remarkably simple formula for the quantum violation of all the Platonic\nBell inequalities, which we prove to attain the maximum possible quantum\nviolation of the Bell inequalities, i.e. the Tsirelson bound. To construct\nPlatonic Bell inequalities with large number of settings, it is crucial to\ncompute the local bound efficiently. For this purpose, we find a numerical\nmethod which allows the computation of the local bound in time polynomial in\nthe number of settings for any bipartite two-outcome Bell inequality if the\nrank of the Bell matrix is smaller than a fixed constant. To show that this\nalgorithm is also useful in practice we compute the local bound of a\n300-setting Platonic Bell inequality based on the halved dodecaplex. In\naddition, we obtain four-dimensional Platonic Bell inequalities for which the\namount of quantum violation exceeds the maximum quantum violation of the famous\nClauser-Horne-Shimony-Holt Bell inequality.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph"],"authors":["K\u00e1roly F.

Both integrators are based on the\nso-called Landau-Lifshitz form of LLG, use mass-lumped variational formulations\ndiscretized by first-order finite elements, and only require the solution of\nlinear systems, despite the nonlinearity of LLG. The first(-order in time)\nmethod combines a linear update with an explicit projection of an intermediate\napproximation onto the unit sphere in order to fulfill the LLG-inherent\nunit-length constraint at the discrete level. In the second(-order in time)\nintegrator, the projection step is replaced by a linear constraint-preserving\nvariational formulation.

As the CS thins, the\nstrength of the reconnecting field increases, and adiabatic invariance in the\ninflowing fluid elements produces a field-biased pressure anisotropy with\nexcess perpendicular pressure. At large plasma beta, this anisotropy excites\nthe mirror instability, which deforms the reconnecting field on ion-Larmor\nscales and dramatically reduces the effective thickness of the CS. Tearing\nmodes whose wavelengths are comparable to that of the mirrors then become\nunstable, triggering reconnection on smaller scales and at earlier times than\nwould have occurred if the thinning CS were to have retained its Harris\nprofile. A novel method for identifying and tracking X-points is introduced,\nyielding X-point separations that are initially intermediate between the\nperpendicular and parallel mirror wavelengths in the upstream plasma. These\nmirror-stimulated tearing modes ultimately grow and merge to produce island\nwidths comparable to the CS thickness, an outcome we verify across a range of\nCS formation timescales and initial CS widths. Our results may find their most\nimmediate application in the tearing disruption of magnetic folds generated by\nturbulent dynamo in weakly collisional, high-beta, astrophysical plasmas.","category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":["astro-ph.HE","physics.plasm-ph"],"authors":["Himawan W.

The RIS is a software-defined array\nof unit cells that can be controlled in terms of the scattering and reflection\nprofiles to focus the incoming signals from the transmitter to the receiver.\nThe benefit of the RIS is to improve the coverage and spectral efficiency for\nwireless communications by overcoming physical obstructions of the\nline-of-sight (LoS) links. The selection process of the RIS beam codeword (out\nof a pre-defined codebook) is formulated as a DNN, while the operations of the\ntransmitter-receiver pair are modeled as two DNNs, one for the encoder (at the\ntransmitter) and the other one for the decoder (at the receiver) of an\nautoencoder, by accounting for channel effects including those induced by the\nRIS in between. The underlying DNNs are jointly trained to minimize the symbol\nerror rate at the receiver. Numerical results show that the proposed design\nachieves major gains in error performance with respect to various baseline\nschemes, where no RIS is used or the selection of the RIS beam is separated\nfrom the design of the transmitter-receiver pair.","category":"cs.NI","categories":["cs.NI","cs.LG"],"authors":["Tugba Erpek","Yalin E.

An\ninteresting question is, given a finite $V$, what percentage of the shuttled\npairs end up as a Josephson supercurrent? This fraction does not seem to have\nbeen measured. Here we show that, in high-transparency junctions based on the\ntype II Dirac semimetal MoTe$_2$, the MAR leads to a stair-case profile in the\ncurrent-voltage ($I$-$V$) response, corresponding to pairs shuttled\nincoherently by the $n^{th}$-order process. By varying the phase $\\varphi$\nacross the junction, we demonstrate that a Josephson supercurrent ${\\bf J}_{\\rm\ns}\\sim \\sin\\varphi$ co-exists with the MAR steps, even at large $V$. The\nobserved linear increase in the amplitude of ${\\bf J}_{\\rm s}$ with $n$ (for\nsmall $n$) implies that ${\\bf J}_{\\rm s}$ originates from the population of\npairs that are coherently shuttled. We infer that the MAR steps and the\nsupercurrent are complementary aspects of the Andreev process. The experiment\nyields the percentage of shuttled pairs that form the supercurrent. At large\n$V$, the coherent fraction is initially linear in $n$. However, as $V\\to 0$\n($n\\gg 1$), almost all the pairs end up as the observed Josephson supercurrent.","category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":["cond-mat.supr-con","quant-ph"],"authors":["Zheyi Zhu","Stephan Kim","Shiming Lei","Leslie M.

But radar is also a\nparticularly challenging sensing modality due to the radar noises. Recent works\nhave made enormous progress in classifying free and occupied spaces in radar\nimages by leveraging lidar label supervision. However, there are still several\nunsolved issues. Firstly, the sensing distance of the results is limited by the\nsensing range of lidar. Secondly, the performance of the results is degenerated\nby lidar due to the physical sensing discrepancies between the two sensors. For\nexample, some objects visible to lidar are invisible to radar, and some objects\noccluded in lidar scans are visible in radar images because of the radar's\npenetrating capability. These sensing differences cause false positive and\npenetrating capability degeneration, respectively.\n  In this paper, we propose training data preprocessing and polar sliding\nwindow inference to solve the issues. The data preprocessing aims to reduce the\neffect caused by radar-invisible measurements in lidar scans. The polar sliding\nwindow inference aims to solve the limited sensing range issue by applying a\nnear-range trained network to the long-range region. Instead of using common\nCartesian representation, we propose to use polar representation to reduce the\nshape dissimilarity between long-range and near-range data. We find that\nextending a near-range trained network to long-range region inference in the\npolar space has 4.2 times better IoU than in Cartesian space.

Therefore, precisely estimating the\nvisibility under foggy weather can significantly benefit traffic management and\nsafety. To address this, most current methods use professional instruments\noutfitted at fixed locations on the roads to perform the visibility\nmeasurement; these methods are expensive and less flexible. In this paper, we\npropose an innovative end-to-end convolutional neural network framework to\nestimate the visibility leveraging Koschmieder's law exclusively using the\nimage data. The proposed method estimates the visibility by integrating the\nphysical model into the proposed framework, instead of directly predicting the\nvisibility value via the convolutional neural work. Moreover, we estimate the\nvisibility as a pixel-wise visibility map against those of previous visibility\nmeasurement methods which solely predict a single value for an entire image.\nThus, the estimated result of our method is more informative, particularly in\nuneven fog scenarios, which can benefit to developing a more precise early\nwarning system for foggy weather, thereby better protecting the intelligent\ntransportation infrastructure systems and promoting its development. To\nvalidate the proposed framework, a virtual dataset, FACI, containing 3,000\nfoggy images in different concentrations, is collected using the AirSim\nplatform.

However,\na successful implementation of a scheme of QKD requires identity authentication\nas a prerequisite. A security loophole in the identity authentication scheme\nmay lead to the vulnerability of the entire secure communication scheme.\nConsequently, identity authentication is extremely important and in the last\nthree decades several schemes for identity authentication, using quantum\nresources have been proposed. The chronological development of these protocols,\nwhich are now referred to as quantum identity authentication (QIA) protocols,\nare briefly reviewed here with specific attention to the causal connection\ninvolved in their development. The existing protocols are classified on the\nbasis of the required quantum resources and their relative merits and demerits\nare analyzed. Further, in the process of the classification of the protocols\nfor QIA, it's observed that the existing protocols can also be classified in a\nfew groups based on the inherent computational tasks used to design the\nprotocols. Realization of these symmetries has led to the possibility of\ndesigning a set of new protocols for quantum identity authentication, which are\nbased on the existing schemes of the secure computational and communication\ntasks. The security of such protocols is also critically analyzed.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph","cs.CR"],"authors":["Arindam Dutta","Anirban Pathak"],"published":"2021-12-08","updated":"2021-12-08","doi":null}

We use a few simple\nquantum mechanical models to expound where the fallacy originated: The highly\nsqueezed ellipse quadrature in phase space cannot be simplified to a line, and\nthe Wigner function cannot be replaced by a delta function. These amount to\ntaking only the leading order contributions in seeking the semiclassical limit\nand ignoring the subdominant contributions where quantum features reside.

It is the principle goal of this paper to analyze what is the\nback-reacted geometry that corresponds to a given quantum state. The story is\nshown to be dramatically different for the Hartle-Hawking state (HH) and for\nthe Boulware state. In the HH case the back-reacted geometry is a modification\nof the classical black hole metric that still has a smooth horizon with a\nregular curvature.

The value of the metric at the throat is\nbounded by the inverse of the classical black hole entropy. On the other side\nof the throat the spacetime is ended at a null singularity.

A physically\nimportant class of PIDs are those that do not require quantum memory to\nimplement, and these are naturally \"free\" in this resource theory. The\ntraditional notion of measurement incompatibility emerges as a resource in this\ntheory since any PID controlling an incompatible family of instruments requires\nquantum memory to build. We identify an incompatibility partial ordering of\nPIDs based on whether one can be transformed into another using processes that\ndo not require additional quantum memory.

Ultimately our results\nprovide an operational characterization of incompatibility, and they offer\ndevice-independent tests for incompatibility in the most general types of\nquantum instruments.

To avoid scattering problems arising from common UC\nmaterials based on micro-crystalline powders, in this work concentrators are\ninvestigated with mono-crystalline up-converters in silicon-based tandem\ndevices. An external quantum efficiency (EQE) of 6% with 1493 nm infrared\nillumination at $876 W\/m^2$ was obtained in upconverter device with concave\nintegrated optics. At an irradiance higher than $90 W\/m^2$ (equivalent to 2.95x\nin the 1450-1600 nm range), the non-concentrating UC-SC exhibited 1.5x higher\nEQE than the UC-SC with CPC, while below $90 W\/m^2$ the CPC UC-SC exhibited\n1.95x higher EQE than the non-concentrating reference device.

The vulnerability originates from the fact that even though each\nindividual parameter receives a value in the recommended value range, certain\ncombinations of parameter values may affect the drone physical stability. In\nthis paper we develop a novel learning-guided search system to find such\ncombinations, that we refer to as incorrect configurations. Our system applies\nmetaheuristic search algorithms mutating configurations to detect the\nconfiguration parameters that have values driving the drone to unstable\nphysical states. To guide the mutations, our system leverages a machine\nlearning predictor as the fitness evaluator. Finally, by utilizing\nmulti-objective optimization, our system returns the feasible ranges based on\nthe mutation search results. Because in our system the mutations are guided by\na predictor, evaluating the parameter configurations does not require\nrealistic\/simulation executions. Therefore, our system supports a comprehensive\nand yet efficient detection of incorrect configurations. We have carried out an\nexperimental evaluation of our system. The evaluation results show that the\nsystem successfully reports potentially incorrect configurations, of which over\n85% lead to actual unstable physical states.","category":"cs.RO","categories":["cs.RO","cs.CR","cs.SY","eess.SY"],"authors":["Ruidong Han","Chao Yang","Siqi Ma","JiangFeng Ma","Cong Sun","Juanru Li","Elisa Bertino"],"published":"2021-12-07","updated":"2021-12-07","doi":null}

However, to date it is unclear if one can represent antisymmetric\nfunctions of physical interest, and it is difficult to measure the\nexpressiveness of the antisymmetric layer. This work attempts to address this\nproblem by introducing explicitly antisymmetrized universal neural network\nlayers as a diagnostic tool. We first introduce a generic antisymmetric (GA)\nlayer, which we use to replace the entire antisymmetric layer of the highly\naccurate ansatz known as the FermiNet. We demonstrate that the resulting\nFermiNet-GA architecture can yield effectively the exact ground state energy\nfor small systems. We then consider a factorized antisymmetric (FA) layer which\nmore directly generalizes the FermiNet by replacing products of determinants\nwith products of antisymmetrized neural networks. Interestingly, the resulting\nFermiNet-FA architecture does not outperform the FermiNet. This suggests that\nthe sum of products of antisymmetries is a key limiting aspect of the FermiNet\narchitecture. To explore this further, we investigate a slight modification of\nthe FermiNet called the full determinant mode, which replaces each product of\ndeterminants with a single combined determinant. The full single-determinant\nFermiNet closes a large part of the gap between the standard single-determinant\nFermiNet and FermiNet-GA. Surprisingly, on the nitrogen molecule at a\ndissociating bond length of 4.0 Bohr, the full single-determinant FermiNet can\nsignificantly outperform the standard 64-determinant FermiNet, yielding an\nenergy within 0.4 kcal\/mol of the best available computational benchmark.","category":"physics.comp-ph","categories":["physics.comp-ph","cs.LG","physics.chem-ph"],"authors":["Jeffmin Lin","Gil Goldshlager","Lin Lin"],"published":"2021-12-07","updated":"2021-12-07","doi":null}

This effect can benefit or harm\nphotovoltaic performance given that the improvement of photoluminescence\nquantum efficiency and open-circuit voltage is accompanied by a reduction of\nthe diffusion length. This reduction will eventually lead to inefficient\ncarrier collection at high doping densities. The photovoltaic performance might\nimprove at an optimum doping density which depends on a range of factors such\nas the mobilities of the different layers and the ratio of the capture cross\nsections for electrons and holes.","category":"cond-mat.mtrl-sci","categories":["cond-mat.mtrl-sci","physics.app-ph"],"authors":["Basita Das","Irene Aguilera","Uwe Rau","Thomas Kirchartz"],"published":"2021-12-07","updated":"2021-12-07","doi":null}

The tube waves have been exploited in the past to infer the in-situ\nhydraulic properties. In order to understand better the physical mechanisms\nunderlying the generation of tube waves at a fault zone, we develop a new model\nthat calculates the pressure responses in a borehole. The model incorporates\nsimultaneous effects of elastic impedance boundaries, fluid infiltration from\nporoelastic formation, and irregularities in the borehole radius. The\nanalytical tube-wave amplitudes are derived from the new model assuming a\nnormally incident plane P wave, verified by complete numerical solutions for\nBiot's theory of dynamic poroelasticity.

The model\nalso enables the prediction of a VSP response at a major fault zone in Japan\n(Nojima fault).

The studied populations mostly\nconsisted of G, K & M stars, with relatively few more massive Herbig stars.\nWith GAIA updated distances, now is a good time to use ALMA archival data for a\nHerbig disk population study and take an important step forward in our\nunderstanding of planet formation. This work determines the masses and sizes of\nall Herbig dust disks observed with ALMA to date out to 450 pc. These masses\nand sizes are put into context of the Lupus and Upper Sco T Tauri disk\npopulations. ALMA Band 6 and Band 7 archival data of 36 Herbig stars are used,\nmaking this work 64% complete excluding Orion. Using stellar parameters and\ndistances the dust masses and sizes of the disks are determined and survival\nanalysis is used to make cumulative distributions of the dust masses and radii.\nHerbig disks have a higher dust mass than the T Tauri disk populations of Lupus\nand Upper Sco by factors of $\\sim3$ and $\\sim7$ respectively. In addition,\nHerbig disks are often larger than the typical T Tauri disk. Although the\nmasses and sizes of Herbig disks extend over a similar range as those of T\nTauri disks, the distributions of masses and sizes of Herbig disks are\nsignificantly skewed toward higher values. Lastly, group I disks are more\nmassive than group II disks. Based on these findings we speculate that these\ndifferences between Herbig and T Tauri disks find their origin in an initial\ndisk mass that scales with the stellar mass, and that subsequent disk evolution\nenlarges the observable differences, especially if (sub)mm continuum optical\ndepth plays a role. Moreover, the larger disk masses and sizes of Herbig stars\ncould be linked to the increasing prevalence of giant planets with host star\nmass.","category":"astro-ph.EP","categories":["astro-ph.EP","astro-ph.GA","astro-ph.SR"],"authors":["L.

The analysis in the VSH method\nshows, on one hand, that it is arduous to separate the scalar-type from the\nvector-type polarizations of the electric sector of the Proca field, and on the\nother hand, it displays clearly the electric and the magnetic mode sectors. The\nanalysis in the FKKS method is performed by taking the nonrotating limit of the\nKerr-AdS spacetime, and shows that the ansatz decouples the polarizations in\nthe electric mode sector even in the nonrotating limit. On the other hand, it\ncaptures only two of the three possible polarizations, the magnetic mode sector\nis missing.

The package was\ndesigned to use a small penetrator - nicknamed the mole - to implement a string\nof temperature sensors in the soil to a depth of 5m. The mole itself is\nequipped with sensors to measure a thermal conductivity as it proceeds to\ndepth. The heat flow would be calculated from the product of the temperature\ngradient and the thermal conductivity. To avoid the perturbation caused by\nannual surface temperature variations, the measurements would be taken at a\ndepth between 3 m and 5 m. The mole was designed to penetrate cohesionless soil\nsimilar to Quartz sand which was expected to provide a good analogue material\nfor Martian sand. The sand would provide friction to the buried mole hull to\nbalance the remaining recoil of the mole hammer mechanism that drives the mole\nforward. Unfortunately, the mole did not penetrate more than a mole length of\n40 cm. The failure to penetrate deeper was largely due to a few tens of\ncentimeter thick cohesive duricrust that failed to provide the required\nfriction. Although a suppressor mass and spring in the hammer mechanism\nabsorbed much of the recoil, the available mass did not allow a system that\nwould have eliminated the recoil. The mole penetrated to 40 cm depth benefiting\nfrom friction provided by springs in the support structure from which it was\ndeployed. It was found in addition that the Martian soil provided unexpected\nlevels of penetration resistance that would have motivated to designing a more\npowerful mole. It is concluded that more mass would have allowed to design a\nmore robust system with little or no recoil, more energy of the mole hammer\nmechanism and a more massive support structure.","category":"astro-ph.IM","categories":["astro-ph.IM","astro-ph.EP","physics.geo-ph"],"authors":["T.

Building models are ubiquitous since they\nare needed at each stage of the life of buildings, i.e. for design,\nretrofitting, and control operations.

On the other hand, black-box models are better suited to\ncapture nonlinear building dynamics and thus can often achieve better accuracy,\nbut they require a lot of data and might not follow the laws of physics, a\nproblem that is particularly common for neural network (NN) models. To counter\nthis known generalization issue, physics-informed NNs have recently been\nintroduced, where researchers introduce prior knowledge in the structure of NNs\nto ground them in known underlying physical laws and avoid classical NN\ngeneralization issues.\n  In this work, we present a novel physics-informed NN architecture, dubbed\nPhysically Consistent NN (PCNN), which only requires past operational data and\nno engineering overhead, including prior knowledge in a linear module running\nin parallel to a classical NN. We formally prove that such networks are\nphysically consistent -- by design and even on unseen data -- with respect to\ndifferent control inputs and temperatures outside and in neighboring zones. We\ndemonstrate their performance on a case study, where the PCNN attains an\naccuracy up to $50\\%$ better than a classical physics-based\nresistance-capacitance model on $3$-day long prediction horizons.

However, these methods are notorious for the enormous\namount of required training data which is prohibitively expensive to collect on\nreal robots. A highly popular alternative is to learn from simulations,\nallowing to generate the data much faster, safer, and cheaper. Since all\nsimulators are mere models of reality, there are inevitable differences between\nthe simulated and the real data, often referenced as the 'reality gap'. To\nbridge this gap, many approaches learn one policy from a distribution over\nsimulators. In this paper, we propose to combine reinforcement learning from\nrandomized physics simulations with policy distillation. Our algorithm, called\nDistilled Domain Randomization (DiDoR), distills so-called teacher policies,\nwhich are experts on domains that have been sampled initially, into a student\npolicy that is later deployed. This way, DiDoR learns controllers which\ntransfer directly from simulation to reality, i.e., without requiring data from\nthe target domain. We compare DiDoR against three baselines in three sim-to-sim\nas well as two sim-to-real experiments. Our results show that the target domain\nperformance of policies trained with DiDoR is en par or better than the\nbaselines'. Moreover, our approach neither increases the required memory\ncapacity nor the time to compute an action, which may well be a point of\nfailure for successfully deploying the learned controller.","category":"cs.LG","categories":["cs.LG","cs.RO"],"authors":["Julien Brosseit","Benedikt Hahner","Fabio Muratore","Michael Gienger","Jan Peters"],"published":"2021-12-06","updated":"2021-12-06","doi":null}

Moreover, when CMB lensing from the Planck\nexperiment is included, the ACT-DR4 data now indicates a neutrino mass above\nthe two standard deviations, with $\\Sigma m_{\\nu}=0.60_{-0.50}^{+0.44}$ eV at\n$95 \\%$, while WMAP+SPT-3G provides a weak upper limit of $\\Sigma m_{\\nu}<0.37$\neV at $68 \\%$ C.L.. Interestingly, these results are consistent with the Planck\nCMB+Lensing constraint of $\\Sigma m_{\\nu} = 0.41_{-0.25}^{+0.17}$ eV at $68 \\%$\nC.L. when variation in the $A_{\\rm lens}$ parameter are considered. We also\nshow that these indications are still present after the inclusion of BAO or\nSN-Ia data in extended cosmologies that are usually considered to solve the\nso-called Hubble tension. A combination of ACT-DR4, WMAP, BAO and constraints\non the Hubble constant from the SH0ES collaboration gives $\\Sigma\nm_{\\nu}=0.39^{+0.13}_{-0.25}$ eV at $68 \\%$ C.L. in extended cosmologies. We\nconclude that a total neutrino mass above the $0.26$ eV limit still provides an\nexcellent fit to several cosmological data and that future data must be\nconsidered before safely ruling it out.","category":"astro-ph.CO","categories":["astro-ph.CO","gr-qc","hep-ph"],"authors":["Eleonora Di Valentino","Alessandro Melchiorri"],"published":"2021-12-06","updated":"2021-12-06","doi":null}

Recent studies,\nhowever, suggest that rules simpler than local averaging may be at play in real\norganisms; for example, fish stochastically align towards only one randomly\nchosen neighbour and yet the schools are highly polarised. Here, we ask -- how\ndo organisms maintain group cohesion? Using a spatially-explicit model,\ninspired from empirical investigations, we show that group cohesion can be\nachieved even when organisms randomly choose only one neighbour to interact\nwith. Cohesion is maintained even in the absence of local averaging that\nrequires interactions with many neighbours. Furthermore, we show that choosing\na neighbour randomly is a better way to achieve cohesion than interacting with\njust its closest neighbour. To understand how cohesion emerges from these\nrandom pairwise interactions, we turn to a graph-theoretic analysis of the\nunderlying dynamic interaction networks. We find that randomness in choosing a\nneighbour gives rise to well-connected networks that essentially cause the\ngroups to stay cohesive.

Computationally, if the luminosity\ncarried through radiation exceeds the local Eddington luminosity in the\nlow-density envelopes of massive stars, it can result in numerical\ndifficulties, inhibiting further computation of stellar models. This problem is\nexacerbated by the fact that very few massive stars are observed beyond the\nHumphreys-Davidson limit, the same region in the Hertzsprung-Russell diagram\nwhere the aforementioned numerical issues relating to the Eddington luminosity\noccur in stellar models. Thus 1D stellar evolution codes have to use pragmatic\nsolutions to evolve massive stars through this computationally difficult phase.\nIn this work, we quantify the impact of these solutions on the evolutionary\nproperties of massive stars. Using the stellar evolution code MESA with\ncommonly used input parameters for massive stellar models, we compute the\nevolution of stars in the initial mass range of 10-110 M$_\\odot$ at one-tenth\nof solar metallicity.

A promising\napproach to address this problem is quantum embedding methods. In particular,\nthe dynamical mean-field theory (DMFT) maps the original system to an effective\nquantum impurity model comprising correlated orbitals embedded in an electron\nbath. The biggest bottleneck in DMFT calculations is numerically solving the\nquantum impurity model, i.e., computing Green's function. Past studies have\nproposed theoretical methods to compute Green's function of a quantum impurity\nmodel in polynomial time using a quantum computer. So far, however, efficient\nmethods for computing the imaginary-time Green's functions have not been\nestablished despite the advantages of the imaginary-time formulation. We\npropose a quantum--classical hybrid algorithm for computing imaginary-time\nGreen's functions on quantum devices with limited hardware resources by\napplying the variational quantum simulation. Using a quantum circuit simulator,\nwe verified this algorithm by computing Green's functions for a dimer model as\nwell as a four-site impurity model obtained by DMFT calculations of the\nsingle-band Hubbard model, although our method can be applied to general\nimaginary-time correlation functions.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph","cond-mat.str-el"],"authors":["Rihito Sakurai","Wataru Mizukami","Hiroshi Shinaoka"],"published":"2021-12-06","updated":"2021-12-06","doi":null}

Ring polymers, in particular, have been the topic of much debate due to\nthe inability of the celebrated reptation model to capture their experimentally\nobserved dynamics. Further, correlating the bulk behavior to the underlying\nmacromolecular dynamics remains a challenge. Macrorheology, microrheology and\nmolecular tracking are powerful methods to determine dynamics of entangled\npolymers across scales, yet these measurements are typically carried out on\ndifferent samples under different conditions, preventing direct coupling. Here,\nwe address these issues by both performing macrorheology and imaging\nfluorescent-labeled DNA molecules in entangled solutions of ring and linear DNA\nas well as their blends with varying fractions of dextran. Importantly, our\ndifferent measurements are carried out on the same samples under the same\nconditions.

We further\nincorporate the most recently developed sinusoidal representation network\n(SIREN) into the proposed network to implicitly represent the highly dynamic\nphases of all possible paths, which usually cannot be well predicted by the\nconventional neural networks with non-periodic activators. The resultant\nframework of Cosine-Gaussian Radial Basis Function network (C-GRBFnet) is also\nextended to the MIMO channel case. Key performance measures including\nprediction accuracy, convergence speed, network scale and robustness to channel\nestimation error are comprehensively evaluated and compared with existing\npopular networks, which show that our proposed network is much more efficient\nin representing, learning and predicting wireless channels in a given\ncommunication environment.","category":"eess.SP","categories":["eess.SP"],"authors":["Zhuoran Xiao","Zhaoyang Zhang","Chongwen Huang","Xiaoming Chen","Caijun Zhong","M\u00e9rouane Debbah"],"published":"2021-12-05","updated":"2021-12-05","doi":null}

We then study the pairing symmetry in this system\nby using large scale variational Monte Carlo approach. Our results yield the\nintraorbital $d_{x^2-y^2}$-wave singlet pairing as the leading pairing symmetry\nin the nickelates, which is analogous to the cuprates. However, there exist two\nimportant differences between the physical properties of the two families due\nto the fact that at the low Sr-doping regime, while the Ni-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$\norbitals remain half-filled and singly-occupied to form a Mott-insulating\nbackground, the Ni-$3d_{xy}$ orbitals accommodate nearly all the extra doped\nholes, which move freely on this background. The first difference lies in the\nsingle-particle aspect: while the $3d_{x^2-y^2}$ degree of freedom remains Mott\ninsulating with spectra weight pinned down at zero at low dopings, the\n$3d_{xy}$ one behaves as Fermi liquid with spectra weight near 1. The second\ndifference lies in the pairing aspect: while the huge\nintra-$3d_{x^2-y^2}$-orbital pairing gap is actually a pseudo gap which has\nnothing to do with the SC, the small intra-$3d_{xy}$-orbital pairing gap serves\nas the true superconducting pairing gap, which is related to the $T_c$ via the\nBCS relation.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.02454","title":"Axial Higgs Mode Detected by Quantum Pathway Interference in RTe3","abstract":"The observation of the Higgs boson solidified the standard model of particle\nphysics. However, explanations of anomalies (e.g. dark matter) rely on further\nsymmetry breaking calling for an undiscovered axial Higgs mode. In condensed\nmatter the Higgs was seen in magnetic, superconducting and charge density\nwave(CDW) systems. Uncovering a low energy mode's vector properties is\nchallenging, requiring going beyond typical spectroscopic or scattering\ntechniques. Here, we discover an axial Higgs mode in the CDW system RTe3 using\nthe interference of quantum pathways. In RTe3 (R=La,Gd), the electronic\nordering couples bands of equal or different angular momenta. As such, the\nRaman scattering tensor associated to the Higgs mode contains both symmetric\nand antisymmetric components, which can be excited via two distinct, but\ndegenerate pathways. This leads to constructive or destructive interference of\nthese pathways, depending on the choice of the incident and Raman scattered\nlight polarization.

Such issues might be addressed by training\ndeep learning (DL) models to learn and predict blood flow characteristics using\na dataset generated by CFD simulations of simplified double stenosed artery\nmodels with different configurations. When blood flow patterns are compared\nthrough an actual double stenosed artery model, derived from IVUS imaging, it\nis revealed that the sinusoidal approximation of stenosed neck geometry, which\nhas been widely used in previous research works, fails to effectively represent\nthe effects of a real constriction. As a result, a novel geometric\nrepresentation of the constricted neck is proposed which, in terms of a\ngeneralized simplified model, outperforms the former assumption. The sequential\nchange in artery lumen diameter and flow parameters along the length of the\nvessel presented opportunities for the use of LSTM and GRU DL models. However,\nwith the small dataset of short lengths of doubly constricted blood arteries,\nthe basic neural network model outperforms the specialized RNNs for most flow\nproperties. LSTM, on the other hand, performs better for predicting flow\nproperties with large fluctuations, such as varying blood pressure over the\nlength of the vessels. Despite having good overall accuracies in training and\ntesting across all the properties for the vessels in the dataset, the GRU model\nunderperforms for an individual vessel flow prediction in all cases. The\nresults also point to the need of individually optimized hyperparameters for\neach property in any model rather than aiming to achieve overall good\nperformance across all outputs with a single set of hyperparameters.","category":"physics.med-ph","categories":["physics.med-ph","cs.LG"],"authors":["Ishat Raihan Jamil","Mayeesha Humaira"],"published":"2021-12-04","updated":"2021-12-04","doi":null}

{"arxiv_id":"2112.02153","title":"Standard Self-Confinement and Extrinsic Turbulence Models for Cosmic Ray Transport are Fundamentally Incompatible with Observations","abstract":"Models for cosmic ray (CR) dynamics fundamentally depend on the rate of CR\nscattering from magnetic fluctuations. In the ISM, for CRs with energies\n~MeV-TeV, these fluctuations are usually attributed either to 'extrinsic\nturbulence' (ET) -- a cascade from larger scales -- or 'self-confinement' (SC)\n-- self-generated fluctuations from CR streaming. Using simple analytic\narguments and detailed 'live' numerical CR transport calculations in galaxy\nsimulations, we show that both of these, in standard form, cannot explain even\nbasic qualitative features of observed CR spectra. For ET, any spectrum that\nobeys critical balance or features realistic anisotropy, or any spectrum that\naccounts for finite damping below the dissipation scale, predicts qualitatively\nincorrect spectral shapes and scalings of B\/C and other species. Even if\nsomehow one ignored both anisotropy and damping, observationally-required\nscattering rates disagree with ET predictions by orders-of-magnitude. For SC,\nthe dependence of driving on CR energy density means that it is nearly\nimpossible to recover observed CR spectral shapes and scalings, and again there\nis an orders-of-magnitude normalization problem. But more severely, SC\nsolutions with super-Alfvenic streaming are unstable. In live simulations, they\nrevert to either arbitrarily-rapid CR escape with zero secondary production, or\nto bottleneck solutions with far-too-strong CR confinement and secondary\nproduction. Resolving these fundamental issues without discarding basic plasma\nprocesses requires invoking different drivers for scattering fluctuations.\nThese must act on a broad range of scales with a power spectrum obeying several\nspecific (but plausible) constraints.","category":"astro-ph.HE","categories":["astro-ph.HE","astro-ph.CO","astro-ph.GA","physics.plasm-ph","physics.space-ph"],"authors":["Philip F.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.02036","title":"Ultrafast tunable lasers using lithium niobate integrated photonics","abstract":"Recent advances in the processing of thin-film LNOI have enabled low-loss\nphotonic integrated circuits, modulators with improved half-wave voltage,\nelectro-optic frequency combs and novel on-chip electro-optic devices, with\napplications ranging from 5G telecommunication and microwave photonics to\nmicrowave-to-optical quantum interfaces. Lithium niobate integrated photonic\ncircuits could equally be the basis of integrated narrow-linewidth\nfrequency-agile lasers. Pioneering work on polished lithium niobate crystal\nresonators has led to the development of electrically tunable narrow-linewidth\nlasers. Here we report low-noise frequency-agile lasers based on lithium\nniobate integrated photonics and demonstrate their use for coherent laser\nranging. This is achieved through heterogeneous integration of ultra-low-loss\nsilicon nitride photonic circuits with thin-film lithium niobate via direct\nwafer bonding. This platform features low propagation loss of 8.5 dB\/m enabling\nnarrow-linewidth lasing (intrinsic linewidth of 3 kHz) by self-injection\nlocking to a III-V semiconductor laser diode. The hybrid mode of the resonator\nallows electro-optical laser frequency tuning at a speed of 12 PHz\/s with high\nlinearity, low hysteresis and while retaining narrow linewidth. Using this\nhybrid integrated laser, we perform a proof-of-concept FMCW LiDAR ranging\nexperiment, with a resolution of 15 cm. By fully leveraging the high\nelectro-optic coefficient of lithium niobate, with further improvements in\nphotonic integrated circuits design, these devices can operate with\nCMOS-compatible voltages, or achieve mm-scale distance resolution. Endowing low\nloss silicon nitride integrated photonics with lithium niobate, gives a\nplatform with wide transparency window, that can be used to realize ultrafast\ntunable lasers from the visible to the mid-infrared, with applications from OCT\nand LiDAR to environmental sensing.","category":"physics.optics","categories":["physics.optics","physics.app-ph"],"authors":["Viacheslav Snigirev","Annina Riedhauser","Grigory Lihachev","Johann Riemensberger","Rui Ning Wang","Charles Moehl","Mikhail Churaev","Anat Siddharth","Guanhao Huang","Youri Popoff","Ute Drechsler","Daniele Caimi","Simon Hoenl","Junqiu Liu","Paul Seidler","Tobias J.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.02035","title":"Dephasing-enhanced performance in quasiperiodic thermal machines","abstract":"Understanding and controlling quantum transport in low-dimensional systems is\npivotal for heat management at the nanoscale. One promising strategy to obtain\nthe desired transport properties is to engineer particular spectral structures.\nIn this work we are interested in quasiperiodic disorder - incommensurate with\nthe underlying periodicity of the lattice - which induces fractality in the\nenergy spectrum. A well known example is the Fibonacci model which, despite\nbeing non-interacting, yields anomalous diffusion with a continuously varying\ndynamical exponent smoothly crossing over from superdiffusive to subdiffusive\nregime as a function of potential strength. We study the finite-temperature\nelectric and heat transport in this model in the absence and in the presence of\ndephasing. Dephasing causes both thermal and electric transport to become\ndiffusive, thereby making thermal and electrical conductivities finite in the\nthermodynamic limit. Thus, in the subdiffusive regime it leads to enhancement\nof transport. We find that the thermal and electric conductivities have\nmultiple peaks as a function of dephasing strength. Remarkably, we observe that\nthe thermal and electrical conductivities are not proportional to each other, a\nclear violation of Wiedemann-Franz law, and the position of their maxima can\ndiffer. We argue that this feature can be utilized to enhance performance of\nquantum thermal machines. In particular, we show that by tuning the strength of\nthe dephasing we can enhance the performance of the device in regimes where it\nacts as an autonomous refrigerator.","category":"cond-mat.dis-nn","categories":["cond-mat.dis-nn","cond-mat.mes-hall","quant-ph"],"authors":["Cecilia Chiaracane","Archak Purkayastha","Mark T.

However,\naccurately representing the Fermi-Hubbard ground state for large instances may\nbe beyond the reach of near-term quantum hardware. Here we show experimentally\nthat an efficient, low-depth variational quantum algorithm with few parameters\ncan reproduce important qualitative features of medium-size instances of the\nFermi-Hubbard model. We address 1x8 and 2x4 instances on 16 qubits on a\nsuperconducting quantum processor, substantially larger than previous work\nbased on less scalable compression techniques, and going beyond the family of\n1D Fermi-Hubbard instances, which are solvable classically. Consistent with\npredictions for the ground state, we observe the onset of the metal-insulator\ntransition and Friedel oscillations in 1D, and antiferromagnetic order in both\n1D and 2D. We use a variety of error-mitigation techniques, including\nsymmetries of the Fermi-Hubbard model and a recently developed technique\ntailored to simulating fermionic systems. We also introduce a new variational\noptimisation algorithm based on iterative Bayesian updates of a local surrogate\nmodel.

Excellent\nphysical properties together with commercial availability have made this\nmaterial extremely compelling for the photonics community. Low-voltage,\nhigh-speed modulators, electro-optic frequency combs, and novel on-chip\nelectro-optic devices have been demonstrated, with applications ranging from\nmicrowave photonics to quantum interfaces. Yet to date, LiNbO3 PICs have mostly\nbeen fabricated using highly specialized etching techniques that are not part\nof the CMOS process and that lack the reproducibility and scalability exhibited\nby, e.g., silicon photonics. The typically used ridge waveguides make input\ncoupling inherently inefficient and limit opportunities for hybrid integration.\nWidespread future application of thin-film LiNbO3 requires a reliable and\nscalable solution using standard processing and precise lithographic control.\nHere, we overcome the abovementioned challenges by employing wafer-scale\nbonding of thin-film LiNbO3 with planarized Si3N4 PICs fabricated using the\nphotonic Damascene process. We demonstrate a scalable, high-yield LiNbO3\nintegrated photonic platform that maintains the ultra-low propagation losses (<\n0.1 dB\/cm) of the underlying Si3N4 waveguides and that is compatible with\nconventional CMOS photonics. We realize a variety of photonic devices on a\nsingle wafer, including individual resonators with ultra-high quality factors\n(Q > 4 Mio), electro-optic frequency combs, and voltage-tunable photonic\ndimers. We also perform nonlinear frequency conversion, enabling\ncarrier-envelope phase detection of a femtosecond laser. Importantly, the\ndevices exhibit efficient input coupling (18% fiber-to-fiber). Our hybrid\nplatform thus provides a reliable, foundry-ready, and low-loss approach to\nLiNbO3 integrated photonics.","category":"physics.optics","categories":["physics.optics","physics.app-ph"],"authors":["Mikhail Churaev","Annina Riedhauser","Rui Ning Wang","Charles M\u00f6hl","Terence Bl\u00e9sin","Miles A.

Recently, Chen et al.

Here we present a quasinormal mode (QNM) approach to model a\nsimilar index-modulated ring resonator working near an EP and show the same\nunusual chiral power flow properties from LP emitters, in direct agreement with\nthe experimental results. We explain these results quantitatively without\ninvoking the interpretation of a missing dimension (the Jordan vector) and a\ndecoupling from the cavity eigenmodes, since the correct eigenmodes are the\nQNMs which explain the chiral emission using only two cavity modes. By coupling\na LP emitter with the dominant two QNMs of the ring resonator, we show how the\nchiral emission depend on the position and orientation of the emitter, which is\nalso verified by the excellent agreement with respect to the power flow between\nthe QNM theory and full numerical dipole solutions. We also show how a normal\nmode solution will fail to capture the correct chirality since it does not take\ninto account the essential QNM phase. Moreover, we demonstrate how one can\nachieve frequency-dependent chiral emission, and replace lossy materials with\ngain materials in the index modulation to reverse the chirality.","category":"physics.optics","categories":["physics.optics"],"authors":["Juanjuan Ren","Sebastian Franke","Stephen Hughes"],"published":"2021-12-03","updated":"2021-12-03","doi":null}

This decomposition leads to the nonlinear\nlow-wavenumber group that supports the self-sustaining process within the given\nintegral length scales, whereas the linearised high-wavenumber group is not\nable to do so, unlike the GQL models in Part 1 which place a minimal\nmathematical description for the self-sustaining process across all integral\nscales.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.01966","title":"Introduction to Logical Entropy and its Relationship to Shannon Entropy","abstract":"We live in the information age. Claude Shannon, as the father of the\ninformation age, gave us a theory of communications that quantified an \"amount\nof information,\" but, as he pointed out, \"no concept of information itself was\ndefined.\" Logical entropy provides that definition. Logical entropy is the\nnatural measure of the notion of information based on distinctions,\ndifferences, distinguishability, and diversity. It is the (normalized)\nquantitative measure of the distinctions of a partition on a set--just as the\nBoole-Laplace logical probability is the normalized quantitative measure of the\nelements of a subset of a set. And partitions and subsets are mathematically\ndual concepts--so the logic of partitions is dual in that sense to the usual\nBoolean logic of subsets, and hence the name \"logical entropy.\" The logical\nentropy of a partition has a simple interpretation as the probability that a\ndistinction or dit (elements in different blocks) is obtained in two\nindependent draws from the underlying set. The Shannon entropy is shown to also\nbe based on this notion of information-as-distinctions; it is the average\nminimum number of binary partitions (bits) that need to be joined to make all\nthe same distinctions of the given partition. Hence all the concepts of simple,\njoint, conditional, and mutual logical entropy can be transformed into the\ncorresponding concepts of Shannon entropy by a uniform non-linear dit-bit\ntransform. And finally logical entropy linearizes naturally to the\ncorresponding quantum concept. The quantum logical entropy of an observable\napplied to a state is the probability that two different eigenvalues are\nobtained in two independent projective measurements of that observable on that\nstate.\n  Keywords: logical entropy, Shannon entropy, partitions, MaxEntropy, quantum\nlogical entropy, von Neumann entropy","category":"cs.IT","categories":["cs.IT","math.IT","quant-ph","81P45, 94A17"],"authors":["David Ellerman"],"published":"2021-12-03","updated":"2021-12-03","doi":null}

The GKS is a second-order\nNavier-Stokes flow solver for the continuum flow. The UGKWP is a multiscale\nmethod for all flow regimes. The wave and particle decomposition in UGKWP\ndepends on the cell's Knudsen number (Kn).

Focusing on low-pressure stimulation with fluid\npressures below the minimum principal stress but above the threshold required\nto overcome the fracture's frictional resistance to slip, this paper presents a\nmathematical model and a numerical solution approach for coupling fluid flow\nwith fracture shearing and propagation. Numerical challenges are related to the\nstrong coupling between hydraulic and mechanical processes, the material\ndiscontinuity the fractures represent in the medium, the wide range of spatial\nscales involved, and the strong effect that fracture deformation and\npropagation have on the physical processes. The solution approach is based on a\nmultiscale strategy. In the macroscale model, flow in and poroelastic\ndeformation of the matrix are coupled with the flow in the fractures and\nfracture contact mechanics, allowing fractures to frictionally slide. Fracture\npropagation is handled at the microscale, where the maximum tangential stress\ncriterion triggers the propagation of fractures, and Paris' law governs the\nfracture growth processes. Simulations show how the shearing of a fracture due\nto fluid injection is linked to fracture propagation, including cases with\nhydraulically and mechanically interacting fractures.","category":"math.NA","categories":["math.NA","cs.NA"],"authors":["Hau Trung Dang","Inga Berre","Eirik Keilegavlen"],"published":"2021-12-03","updated":"2021-12-03","doi":null}

{"arxiv_id":"2112.01658","title":"Virtual Coset Coding for Encrypted Non-Volatile Memories with Multi-Level Cells","abstract":"PCM is a popular backing memory for DRAM main memory in tiered memory\nsystems. PCM has asymmetric access energy; writes dominate reads. MLC asymmetry\ncan vary by an order of magnitude. Many schemes have been developed to take\nadvantage of the asymmetric patterns of 0s and 1s in the data to reduce write\nenergy. Because the memory is non-volatile, data can be recovered via physical\nattack or across system reboot cycles. To protect information stored in PCM\nagainst these attacks requires encryption. Unfortunately, most encryption\nalgorithms scramble 0s and 1s in the data, effectively removing any patterns\nand negatively impacting schemes that leverage data bias and similarity to\nreduce write energy. In this paper, we introduce Virtual Coset Coding (VCC) as\na workload-independent approach that reduces costly symbol transitions for\nstoring encrypted data. VCC is based on two ideas. First, using coset encoding\nwith random coset candidates, it is possible to effectively reduce the\nfrequency of costly bit\/symbol transitions when writing encrypted data. Second,\na small set of random substrings can be used to achieve the same encoding\nefficiency as a large number of random coset candidates, but at a much lower\nencoding\/decoding cost. Additionally, we demonstrate how VCC can be leveraged\nfor energy reduction in combination with fault-mitigation and fault-tolerance\nto dramatically increase the lifetimes of endurance-limited NVMs, such as PCM.\nWe evaluate the design of VCC and demonstrate that it can be implemented\non-chip with only a nominal area overhead. VCC reduces dynamic energy by 22-28%\nwhile maintaining the same performance. Using our multi-objective optimization\napproach achieves at least a 36% improvement in lifetime over the\nstate-of-the-art and at least a 50% improvement in lifetime vs. an unencoded\nmemory, while maintaining its energy savings and system performance.","category":"cs.AR","categories":["cs.AR"],"authors":["Stephen Longofono","Seyed Mohammad Seyedzadeh","Alex K.

One approach is to perform sampling from a probability distribution\nassociated with a class of highly entangled many-body wavefunctions. It has\nbeen suggested that this approach can be certified with the Linear\nCross-Entropy Benchmark (XEB). We critically examine this notion. First, in a\n\"benign\" setting where an honest implementation of noisy quantum circuits is\nassumed, we characterize the conditions under which the XEB approximates the\nfidelity. Second, in an \"adversarial\" setting where all possible classical\nalgorithms are considered for comparison, we show that achieving relatively\nhigh XEB values does not imply faithful simulation of quantum dynamics. We\npresent an efficient classical algorithm that, with 1 GPU within 2s, yields\nhigh XEB values, namely 2-12% of those obtained in experiments. By identifying\nand exploiting several vulnerabilities of the XEB, we achieve high XEB values\nwithout full simulation of quantum circuits. Remarkably, our algorithm features\nbetter scaling with the system size than noisy quantum devices for commonly\nstudied random circuit ensembles. To quantitatively explain the success of our\nalgorithm and the limitations of the XEB, we use a theoretical framework in\nwhich the average XEB and fidelity are mapped to statistical models. We\nillustrate the relation between the XEB and the fidelity for quantum circuits\nin various architectures, with different gate choices, and in the presence of\nnoise. Our results show that XEB's utility as a proxy for fidelity hinges on\nseveral conditions, which must be checked in the benign setting but cannot be\nassumed in the adversarial setting. Thus, the XEB alone has limited utility as\na benchmark for quantum advantage.

Our\nmodelling of a semi-flexible filament with a small but finite width is based on\nthe Cosserat theory of elastic rods, which allows for six degrees of freedom at\nevery point on the filament's backbone. In the variational models presented in\nthis paper, a small and discrete set of parameters is used to describe a smooth\nfilament shape having all degrees of freedom allowed in the Cosserat theory.\nTwo main approaches are introduced: one where polynomial spline functions\ndescribe the filament's configuration, and one in which geodesic curves in the\nspace of the configurational degrees of freedom are used.

The dimensionality of spacetime can be defined in various contexts. The\nspectral dimension of spacetime is defined in the context of diffusion\nprocesses on a manifold. We show that a spacetime with zero-point length has\nspectral dimension $3.5$ when the characteristic diffusion time has the size of\nthe zero-point length. The spectral dimension (negatively) diverges for an even\nshorter diffusion time, thus preventing any reliable physical interpretation in\nthe deep ultraviolet regime. The thermodynamic dimension is defined by\nrealizing that the free energy $F(\\beta)$ of a free field or ideal gas at\nfinite temperature ($\\beta^{-1}$) in $D$ dimensions scales as $F\\sim\n\\beta^{-D}$. Using Schwinger's proper time formalism at finite temperature, we\nshow that for spacetime incorporating a zero-point length, the thermodynamic\ndimension reduces to $1.5$ near the Planck scale and then to $1$ in the deep\nultraviolet regime. This signifies a \"phase-transition\" in which a (massless)\nbosonic ideal gas in four dimensions essentially behaves like radiation\n($w=1\/3$) at low energies, whereas near the Planck scale, it behaves\nequivalently to having an equation of state parameter $w=2$.

Although\nquantum evolution is not discussed explicitly in this work, we argue that the\nproper treatment of the $x$ dependence of the gluon distribution encompasses\nthe kinematic constraint that must be imposed on the phase-space of gluon\nfluctuations in the target to ensure stability of small-$x$ evolution.","category":"hep-ph","categories":["hep-ph","nucl-th"],"authors":["Renaud Boussarie","Yacine Mehtar-Tani"],"published":"2021-12-02","updated":"2021-12-02","doi":null}

The PDF sets of\nHERAPDF2.0Jets NNLO were determined with separate fits using two fixed values\nof $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)$, $\\alpha_s(M_Z^2)=0.1155$ and $0.118$, since the latter\nvalue was already chosen for the published HERAPDF2.0 NNLO analysis based on\nHERA inclusive DIS data only. The different sets of PDFs are presented,\nevaluated and compared. The consistency of the PDFs determined with and without\nthe jet data demonstrates the consistency of HERA inclusive and jet-production\ncross-section data. The inclusion of the jet data reduced the uncertainty on\nthe gluon PDF. Predictions based on the PDFs of HERAPDF2.0Jets NNLO give an\nexcellent description of the jet-production data used as input.","category":"hep-ex","categories":["hep-ex","hep-ph"],"authors":["H1","ZEUS Collaborations",":","I.

(If\nthe DM-nucleon interaction is attractive and bound states can be formed, most\nDM bind to nuclei and the density is much lower.)\n  Neufeld and Brach-Neufeld performed experiments to constrain the DM-baryon\nscattering cross section of DM atmosphere around Earth, by measuring the\nevaporation rate of liquid nitrogen in a storage dewar within which various\nmaterials are immersed. If the DM-nitrogen cross section is in an appropriate\nrange, room temperature DM would penetrate the dewar walls and scatter on the\ncold nitrogen, increasing its evaporation rate beyond the observed level.\nLimits on the cross section of DM with other materials than nitrogen are\nobtained by adding known amounts of different materials; if the material is\nheated by interactions with DM, that heats and evaporates the liquid nitrogen.\n  Because Born approximation is in general invalid in much of the relevant\ncross section regime, it is non-trivial to interpret such experimental results\nas a limit on the DM-nucleon cross section.

It shows there are no conditions where\nthe collapse of a very massive star may remain stable, although, for a less\nmassive star, it is possible.

The Bayesian estimator of the property of interest\nrequires the knowledge of the prior distribution, and in many situations, it is\nnot clear which prior should be used. Several estimators have been developed so\nfar, in which the proposed prior was individually tailored for each property of\ninterest; such is the case, for example, for the entropy, the amount of mutual\ninformation, or the correlation between pairs of variables. In this paper we\npropose a general framework to select priors, valid for arbitrary properties.\nWe first demonstrate that only certain aspects of the prior distribution\nactually affect the inference process. We then expand the sought prior as a\nlinear combination of a one-dimensional family of indexed priors, each of which\nis obtained through a maximum entropy approach with constrained mean value of\nthe property under study. In many cases of interest, only one or very few\ncomponents of the expansion turn out to contribute to the Bayesian estimator,\nso it is often valid to only keep a single component. The relevant component is\nselected by the data, so no handcrafted priors are required. We test the\nperformance of this approximation with a few paradigmatic examples, and show\nthat it performs well in comparison to the ad-hoc methods previously proposed\nin the literature. Our method highlights the connection between Bayesian\ninference and equilibrium statistical mechanics, since the most relevant\ncomponent of the expansion can be argued to be the one with the right\ntemperature.","category":"physics.data-an","categories":["physics.data-an","cond-mat.stat-mech","math-ph","math.MP"],"authors":["Dami\u00e1n G.

{"arxiv_id":"2112.00607","title":"Emergent decoherence induced by quantum chaos in a many-body system: A Loschmidt echo observation through NMR","abstract":"In the long quest to identify and compensate the sources of decoherence in\nmany-body systems far from the ground state, the varied family of Loschmidt\nechoes (LEs) became an invaluable tool in several experimental techniques. A LE\ninvolves a time-reversal procedure to assess the effect of perturbations in a\nquantum excitation dynamics. However, when addressing macroscopic systems one\nis repeatedly confronted with limitations that seem insurmountable. This led to\nformulate the \\textit{central hypothesis of irreversibility} stating that the\ntime-scale of decoherence, $T_3$, is proportional to the time-scale of the\nmany-body interactions we reversed, $T_2$. We test this by implementing two\nexperimental schemes based on Floquet Hamiltonians where the effective strength\nof the dipolar spin-spin coupling, i.e. $1\/T_2$, is reduced by a variable scale\nfactor $k$. This extends the perturbations time scale, $T_\\Sigma$, in relation\nto $T_2$. Strikingly, we observe the superposition of the normalized Loschmidt\nechoes for the bigger values of $k$. This manifests the dominance of the\nintrinsic dynamics over the perturbation factors, even when the Loschmidt echo\nis devised to reverse that intrinsic dynamics. Thus, in the limit where the\nreversible interactions dominate over perturbations, the LE decays within a\ntime-scale, $T_3\\approx T_2\/R$ with $R=(0.15 \\pm 0.01)$, confirming the\nemergence of a perturbation independent regime. These results support the\ncentral hypothesis of irreversibility.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph","cond-mat.stat-mech"],"authors":["Claudia M.

As a result, forward modeling errors are inevitable. In\npractice, such model errors tend to be either completely ignored, which leads\nto biased and over-confident inversion results, or only partly taken into\naccount using restrictive Gaussian assumptions. Here, we rely on deep\ngenerative neural networks to learn problem-specific low-dimensional\nprobabilistic representations of the discrepancy between high-fidelity and\nlow-fidelity forward solvers. These representations are then used to\nprobabilistically invert for the model error jointly with the target\ngeophysical property field, using the computationally-cheap, low-fidelity\nforward solver. To this end, we combine a Markov-chain-Monte-Carlo (MCMC)\ninversion algorithm with a trained convolutional neural network of the spatial\ngenerative adversarial network (SGAN) type, whereby at each MCMC step, the\nsimulated low-fidelity forward response is corrected using a proposed\nmodel-error realization. Considering the crosshole ground-penetrating radar\ntraveltime tomography inverse problem, we train SGAN networks on traveltime\ndiscrepancy images between: (1) curved-ray (high fidelity) and straight-ray\n(low fidelity) forward solvers; and (2) finite-difference-time-domain (high\nfidelity) and straight-ray (low fidelity) forward solvers.

In this paper, we study its Lagrangian perspectives and examine\nthe full diffeomorphism (Diff) symmetry and its associated conservation laws in\nHorava gravity.

A\npre-processing procedure is applied first, including a derivative approach and\na PCA-based correction mask, to eliminate common central artifacts (i.e.,\napex-centered column saturation artifact and posterior stromal artifact) and\nenable standardized analysis. The mean intensity stromal-depth profile is then\nextracted over a 6-mm-wide corneal area and analyzed according to our\npreviously developed method deriving quantitative transparency parameters\nrelated to the physics of light propagation in tissues, notably tissular\nheterogeneity (Birge ratio; $B_r$), followed by the photon mean-free path\n($l_s$) in homogeneous tissues (i.e., $B_r \\sim 1$).\n  RESULTS: After confirming stromal homogeneity ($B_r < 10$, IDR: 1.9-5.1), we\nmeasured a median $l_s$ of 570 $\\mu$m (IDR: 270-2400 $\\mu$m).

With constant mode frequency,\nthis density flattening would be responsible for the exhausting of the drive\nwhen large negative density gradients leave the resonance region. The frequency\nchirping, however, causes the resonance radius and the resonance region to\ndrift inward. This drift delays the moment in which the inner density gradient\nreaches the inner boundary of the resonance region. On the other side, the\nisland reconstitutes around the new resonance radius; as a consequence, the\nlarge negative density gradient further moves inward. This process continues as\nlong as it allows to keep the large gradient within the resonance region. When\nthis is no longer possible, the resonant structure ceases to be effective in\ndriving the mode. To further grow, the mode has to tap a different resonant\nstructure, possibly making use of additional frequency variations.","category":"physics.plasm-ph","categories":["physics.plasm-ph"],"authors":["Xin Wang","Sergio Briguglio","Claudio Di Troia","Matteo Falessi","Giuliana Fogaccia","Valeria Fusco","Gregorio Vlad","Fulvio Zonca"],"published":"2021-12-01","updated":"2021-12-06","doi":null}

This phenomenon has become increasingly\npivotal in clarifying the pairing 'enigma' particularly for multiband\nhigh-temperature superconductors. In one-unit-cell (1-UC) FeSe\/SrTiO3, the\nthinnest and highest-Tc member of iron-based superconductors, the standard\nelectron-hole Fermi pocket nesting scenario is apparently not applicable since\nthe Gamma-centered hole pockets are absent, so the actual pairing mechanism is\nthe subject of intense debate. Here, by measuring high-resolution Bogoliubov\nquasiparticle interference, we report observations of highly anisotropic\nmagnetic Cooper pairing in 1-UC FeSe. From a theoretical point of view, it is\nimportant to incorporate effects of electronic correlations within a\nspin-fluctuation pairing calculation, where the dxy orbital becomes\ncoherence-suppressed. The resulting pairing gap is compatible with the\nexperimental findings, which suggests that high-Tc Cooper pairing with orbital\nselectivity applies to 1-UC FeSe. Our findings imply the general existence of\norbital selectivity in iron-based superconductors and the universal importance\nof electron correlations in high-Tc superconductors.","category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":["cond-mat.supr-con","cond-mat.mes-hall","cond-mat.mtrl-sci","cond-mat.str-el"],"authors":["Chaofei Liu","Andreas Kreisel","Shan Zhong","Yu Li","Brian M.

In order to reduce dependency on a classical computer, we use the\nqk-means to perform state discrimination on the IBMQ Bogota device and managed\nto find assignment fidelities of up to 98.7% that were only marginally lower\nthan that of the k-means algorithm. Inspection of assignment fidelity scores\nresulting from applying both algorithms to a combination of quantum states\nshowed concordance to our correlation analysis using Pearson Correlation\ncoefficients, where evidence shows cross-talk in the (1, 2) and (2, 3)\nneighboring qubit couples for the analyzed device.","category":"quant-ph","categories":["quant-ph","cs.LG","81P15 (Primary) 81P40, 68Q12 (Secondary)","J.2"],"authors":["David Quiroga","Prasanna Date","Raphael C.

Electromagnetic simulations were performed to assess the specific\nabsorption rate (SAR) of RF energy around leads with different internal\nstructures. Results When controlling for B1+rms, temperature increase around\nthe lead-tip was significantly lower at the vertical scanner compared to the\nhorizontal scanner (p-value=9.1x10-7). Electromagnetic simulations demonstrated\nup to a 14-fold reduction in the maximum 0.1g-averaged SAR deposited in the\ntissue surrounding the lead-tip in a vertical scanner compared to a horizontal\nscanner for leads with straight and helical internal wires. Conclusions RF\nexperiments and electromagnetic simulations demonstrated consistently lower RF\nheating and power deposition around the DBS lead-tip at the vertical scanner\ncompared to the horizontal scanner. Our simulation results suggest that this\ntrend in heating may potentially extend to leads from other manufacturers.","category":"physics.med-ph","categories":["physics.med-ph"],"authors":["Jasmine Vu","Bhumi Bhusal","Bach T Nguyen","Pia Sanpitak","Elizabeth Nowac","Julie Pilitsis","Joshua Rosenow","Laleh Golestanirad"],"published":"2021-12-01","updated":"2021-12-01","doi":null}

The flow is confined between two horizontal plates which are\nmaintained at different constant temperature, salinity, and different velocity,\nthus setting up a shear across the flow. The lower plate is fixed at higher\ntemperature and salinity, while the overall (unperturbed) density gradient is\nstatically stable. For a wide range of control parameters, and for sufficiently\nstrong perturbation of the conductive initial state, we find that\nstaircase-like structures spontaneously develop, with relatively well-mixed\nlayers separated by sharp interfaces of enhanced scalar gradient. Such\nstaircases appear to be robust even in the presence of strong shear over very\nlong times, although we typically observe early time coarsening of the number\nof observed layers. For the same set of control parameters, different\nasymptotic layered states, with markedly different vertical scalar fluxes, can\narise for different initial perturbation structures. The imposed shear does\nsignificantly spatio-temporally modify the vertical transport of the various\nscalars. The flux ratio (i.e., the ratio between the density fluxes due to the\ntotal (convective and diffusive) salt flux and the total heat flux) is found,\nat steady state, to be essentially equal to the square root of the ratio of the\nsalt diffusivity to the thermal diffusivity, consistently with the physical\nmodel originally proposed by Linden and Shirtcliffe (1978) and the variational\narguments presented by Stern (1982) for unsheared double diffusive convection.","category":"physics.flu-dyn","categories":["physics.flu-dyn"],"authors":["Yantao Yang","Roberto Verzicco","Detlef Lohse","C.

The proposed methodology consists of\ntwo major steps. In the first step, we recast the reliability assessment of MSS\nas a machine learning problem using the framework of PINN. A feedforward neural\nnetwork with two individual loss groups are constructed to encode the initial\ncondition and state transitions governed by ordinary differential equations\n(ODEs) in MSS. Next, we tackle the problem of high imbalance in the magnitude\nof the back-propagated gradients in PINN from a multi-task learning\nperspective.

The gradient\nprojection operation significantly mitigates the detrimental effects caused by\nthe gradient interference when training PINN, thus accelerating the convergence\nspeed of PINN to high-precision solutions to MSS reliability assessment. With\nthe proposed PINN-based framework, we investigate its applications for MSS\nreliability assessment in several different contexts in terms of\ntime-independent or dependent state transitions and system scales varying from\nsmall to medium.

This area deals with the automated division of a network\ninto fundamental building blocks, with the objective of providing a summary of\nits large-scale structure. Despite its importance and widespread adoption,\nthere is a noticeable gap between what is considered the state-of-the-art and\nthe methods that are actually used in practice in a variety of fields. Here we\nattempt to address this discrepancy by dividing existing methods according to\nwhether they have a \"descriptive\" or an \"inferential\" goal. While descriptive\nmethods find patterns in networks based on intuitive notions of community\nstructure, inferential methods articulate a precise generative model, and\nattempt to fit it to data. In this way, they are able to provide insights into\nthe mechanisms of network formation, and separate structure from randomness in\na manner supported by statistical evidence. We review how employing descriptive\nmethods with inferential aims is riddled with pitfalls and misleading answers,\nand thus should be in general avoided. We argue that inferential methods are\nmore typically aligned with clearer scientific questions, yield more robust\nresults, and should be in many cases preferred.

This confirms the\nquantum interference between competing optical nonlinear pathways. Besides\nnonlinearity enhancement, we also demonstrate the novel capability to suppress\nthe material intrinsic nonlinearity. Finally, we use the tunable nonlinearity\nto control the spectral brightness and coincidence-to-accidental ratio of\nsingle-photon generation. This work paves the way towards the complete\nnanoscale control of optical nonlinear processes at quantum level.","category":"physics.optics","categories":["physics.optics","quant-ph"],"authors":["Chaohan Cui","Liang Zhang","Linran Fan"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}

There are two major production techniques of GEM foils: double-mask\nand single-mask etching. Despite being an effective method, an asymmetry is\nobserved between the top and bottom diameters of GEM holes in single mask\ncompared to double mask. In this paper we describe extensive simulations and\nexperimental measurements to study this hole asymmetry and its effect on the\nperformance of GEM based detectors. The experimental data is collected using\nGEM foils of various hole geometries and orientations. In simulations, the same\ndimensions are used to study the properties of the detector. Simulations are\nperformed with the Garfield$^{++}$ simulation package along with ANSYS for\ncreating the geometry of the GEM foils as well as the triple-GEM detector and\nthe meshing needed for the field calculations. The simulation results match the\nobservations from experimental measurements. The gains measured with single and\ntriple-GEM detectors are lower if asymmetric foils are oriented with the\nsmaller diameters towards the readout plane. Detailed simulation of the\namplification and collection steps indicates that the lower gain is attributed\nto a loss of electrons at the GEM3 foil for the first time.","category":"physics.ins-det","categories":["physics.ins-det","hep-ex"],"authors":["Othmane Bouhali","Kerstin Hoepfner","Francesco Ivone","Teruki Kamon","Henning Keller","Shivali Malhotra","Badriya Al Rashdi"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":"10.1088\/1748-0221\/16\/10\/P10032"}

We also probe the feasibility of\nrecovering quantum information from subsystems of a thermalized quantum\nmany-body system or from the radiation of an evaporating black hole, using\nquantities such as relative entropy and Petz map fidelity. A recently developed\ntechnique called the equilibrium approximation allows us to probe these\nquantities at finite temperature.

Inspired by this, we resolve our issues by first carefully treating\nthe Weyl anomaly which receives contributions from the non-constant dilaton,\nand then by computing the ratio of our partition function and the one of a\nstring in AdS$_4\\times \\mathbf{C}P^3$, which is dual to a 1\/2-BPS WL in ABJM.\nCrucially, this approach yields a finite result which matches the corresponding\nratio of WL vevs on the gauge theory side.","category":"hep-th","categories":["hep-th"],"authors":["Fri\u00f0rik Freyr Gautason","Valentina Giangreco M.

The main characteristic of an anomalous metal is the\nsaturation of the low-temperature resistance at a value far smaller than that\npredicted by the Drude formula. This calls into question whether the\nconventional understanding of metals is applicable to bosonic cases. Here, we\nreport two types of bosonic metal states in ultrathin crystalline FeSe films\ngrown on SrTiO3, where the 2D high-temperature superconductivity is confined at\nthe interface. Our experiments are performed on pristine FeSe films and FeSe\nfilms with a triangular array of nano-holes. In pristine FeSe films, the\nbosonic anomalous metal state emerges at a high temperature (around 20 K),\nhigher than all previous observations. In stark contrast, in nanopatterned FeSe\nfilms, the characteristic temperature of the anomalous metal state is\nconsiderably suppressed. In both types of FeSe films, we observe a\nlinear-in-temperature (T-linear) resistance below onset temperature for\nsuperconductivity. Interestingly, the extremely large slope of this T-linear\nresistance, suppressed Hall coefficient and clear h\/2e quantum oscillations\nreveal the bosonic nature of the T-linear resistance, indicating a bosonic\nstrange metal. Our discovery of the high-temperature anomalous metal state and\nthe bosonic strange metal state in the 2D limit motivates further\ninvestigations aimed at unraveling the dissipation mechanism in bosonic metal\nstates.","category":"cond-mat.supr-con","categories":["cond-mat.supr-con","cond-mat.mes-hall","cond-mat.mtrl-sci","cond-mat.str-el"],"authors":["Yanan Li","Yi Liu","Haiwen Liu","Shichao Qi","Haoran Ji","Wenfeng Dong","Yi Sun","Wenhao Zhang","Chengcheng Ji","Zihan Cui","Nitin Samarth","Lili Wang","X.

In this category, both the\ncomplete-active-space second-order perturbation theory (CASPT2) and the\n$N$-electron valence state second-order perturbation theory (NEVPT2) are\ncertainly popular, the latter presenting the advantage of not requiring the\napplication of the empirical ionization-potential-electron-affinity (IPEA) and\nlevel shifts. However, the actual accuracy of these multiconfigurational\napproaches is not settled yet. In this context, the present work relies on\nhighly-accurate \\emph{aug}-cc-pVTZ vertical transition energies for 284 excited\nstates of diverse character determined in 35 small- to medium-sized organic\nmolecules containing from three to six non-hydrogen atoms to assess the\nperformances of these approaches.

We find that both CASPT2 with IPEA\nshift and PC-NEVPT2 provide fairly reliable vertical transition energy\nestimates, with slight overestimations and mean absolute errors of $0.11$ and\n$0.13$ eV, respectively.

In the analysis of stellar spectra, the\nnumerical model often needs to account for binary companions and 3D structures\nin the stellar envelopes. The enigmatic binary (or multiple) system LB-1\nconstitutes a perfect example of such a complex multi-D problem. Aims: To\nimprove our understanding of the LB-1 system, we directly modelled the\nphase-dependent H-alpha line profiles of this system. To this end, we developed\na multi-purpose binary-object spectral-synthesis code in 3D (BOSS-3D). Methods:\nBOSS-3D calculates synthetic line profiles for a given state of the\ncircumstellar material. The standard pz-geometry commonly used for single stars\nis extended by defining individual coordinate systems for each involved object\nand by accounting for the appropriate coordinate transformations. The code is\nthen applied to the LB-1 system, considering two main hypotheses, a binary\ncontaining a stripped star and Be star, or a B star and a black hole with a\ndisc. Results: Comparing these two scenarios, neither model can reproduce the\ndetailed phase-dependent shape of the H-alpha line profiles. A satisfactory\nmatch with the observations, however, is obtained by invoking a disc around the\nprimary object in addition to the Be-star disc or the black-hole accretion\ndisc.

{"arxiv_id":"2111.15187","title":"HyperPCA: a Powerful Tool to Extract Elemental Maps from Noisy Data Obtained in LIBS Mapping of Materials","abstract":"Laser-induced breakdown spectroscopy is a preferred technique for fast and\ndirect multi-elemental mapping of samples under ambient pressure, without any\nlimitation on the targeted element. However, LIBS mapping data have two\npeculiarities: an intrinsically low signal-to-noise ratio due to single-shot\nmeasurements, and a high dimensionality due to the high number of spectra\nacquired for imaging. This is all the truer as lateral resolution gets higher:\nin this case, the ablation spot diameter is reduced, as well as the ablated\nmass and the emission signal, while the number of spectra for a given surface\nincreases. Therefore, efficient extraction of physico-chemical information from\na noisy and large dataset is a major issue. Multivariate approaches were\nintroduced by several authors as a means to cope with such data, particularly\nPrincipal Component Analysis. Yet, PCA is known to present theoretical\nconstraints for the consistent reconstruction of the dataset, and has therefore\nlimitations to efficient interpretation of LIBS mapping data. In this paper, we\nintroduce HyperPCA, a new analysis tool for hyperspectral images based on a\nsparse representation of the data using Discrete Wavelet Transform and\nkernel-based sparse PCA to reduce the impact of noise on the data and to\nconsistently reconstruct the spectroscopic signal, with a particular emphasis\non LIBS data. The method is first illustrated using simulated LIBS mapping\ndatasets to emphasize its performances with highly noisy and\/or highly\ninterfered spectra. Comparisons to standard PCA and to traditional univariate\ndata analyses are provided. Finally, it is used to process real data in two\ncases that clearly illustrate the potential of the proposed algorithm. We show\nthat the method presents advantages both in quantity and quality of the\ninformation recovered, thus improving the physico-chemical characterisation of\nanalysed surfaces.","category":"physics.app-ph","categories":["physics.app-ph","cs.LG","eess.IV"],"authors":["Riccardo Finotello","Mohamed Tamaazousti","Jean-Baptiste Sirven"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}

However, such a process is manual and laborious. Physicians may\nnot identify errors due to time constraints and caseload. We designed a novel\nprescription anomaly detection algorithm that utilizes historical data to\npredict anomalous cases. Such a tool can serve as an electronic peer who will\nassist the peer-review process providing extra safety to the patients. In our\nprimary model, we created two dissimilarity metrics, R and F. R defining how\nfar a new patient's prescription is from historical prescriptions. F represents\nhow far away a patient's feature set is from the group with an identical or\nsimilar prescription. We flag prescription if either metric is greater than\nspecific optimized cut-off values. We used thoracic cancer patients (n=2356) as\nan example and extracted seven features. Here, we report our testing f1 score,\nbetween 75%-94% for different treatment technique groups.

It can also explain why it flags each case and separate prescription\nand non-prescription-related features without learning from the data.","category":"cs.LG","categories":["cs.LG","physics.comp-ph","physics.med-ph"],"authors":["Qiongge Li","Jean Wright","Russell Hales","Ranh Voong","Todd McNutt"],"published":"2021-11-30","updated":"2021-11-30","doi":null}
