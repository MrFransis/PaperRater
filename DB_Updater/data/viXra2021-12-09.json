It will be presented the formula for the fine-structure constant with the golden angle,relativity factor and the fifth power of the golden mean and the simple expression for the fine-structure constant in terms of the Archimedes constant. The exact mathematical expression for the proton to electron mass ratio using Fibonacci and Lucas numbers and other two exact mathematical expressions for the proton to electron mass ratio. New formulas for the Planck length and the Avogadro's number. The unity formulas that connect the fine-structure constant and the proton to electron mass ratio. We will find the formulas that connect the strong coupling constant and the fine-structure constant. The unity formulas that connect the strong coupling constant,the weak coupling constant and the fine-structure constant. It will be presented the mathematical formulas that connects the strong coupling constant,the weak coupling constant,the proton to electron mass ratio,the fine-structure constant,the ratio of electric force to gravitational force between electron and proton,the Avogadro's number,the gravitational coupling constant for the electron and the gravitational coupling constant of proton. Also we will find the formulas for the Gravitational constant. It will be presented that the gravitational fine structure constant is a simple analogy between atomic physics and cosmology. Finally we will find the expression that connects the gravitational fine structure constant with the four coupling constants. Perhaps the gravitational fine structure constant is the coupling constant for the fifth force. In this work we will assume the theoretical value of the strong coupling constant. This value fits perfectly in the measurement of the strong coupling constant. Also we followed  the  energy wave theory and the fractal space-time theory.","category":"Nuclear and Atomic Physics","authors":["Stergios Pellis"],"published":"2022-01-07"}

In the discipline of cellular automata (CA), not all CA abstractions of replication include any origin pathway to the replicating structures. In this work, an origin for the J.

This origin pathway requires introduction of one oriented state and three other states, all of which permanently disappear from the subsequent replication process. Origin of the replicator and subsequent replication display three sequential and spatially-expanding domains of counter-clockwise rotation: the oriented state of a single cell rotates as the first replicator structure develops around it, followed by rotation of the 2x2 cell information loop as a replication cycle proceeds, and in subsequent cycles of replication, orientation of a parent replicator also rotates counter-clockwise as directions of replication are successively blocked by the replicator\u2019s children.","category":"Physics of Biology","authors":["Perry W.

The impact-structure is noticeable on a magnetic-anomaly map and on a contrast-enhanced satellite map. It is a yet unknown impact structure ! This impact crater is very interesting, especially for Astrobiologists, because some of the earliest life-forms on Earth developed inside the crater-area after the impact ! The Dresser- and Strelley-Pool- Formations inside the crater contain some of the oldest fosselized Stromatolites on Earth !  \r\nI have analysed some rock-samples which I have collected along a mainroad which passes the crater just outside its northern crater-rim-area (samples No: 14 to 21).  \r\nNote that the original crater-wall was later deformed by an (expansion) tectonic process that obviously was caused by the impact. And the impact in all probability was an oblique impact, which means the impactor impacted in a relatively shallow angle of \u226430\u00b0. Because of the oblique impact and the tectonic-process, fragments of the original crater-wall ended up further north close to the road were I collected the samples. Therefore the collected samples probably originate from the elevated crater-rim area.\r\nThe Raman spectra of quartz from the sample-sites 14, 16, 18 and 21-A collected along the main-road provide first evidence for an impact (shock) event as the probable cause of the described structure.  The shifts of the main Raman peaks, of analysed quartz grains from these sites, to the lower frequencies 463, 259\/266, 125 cm-1 and 463, 262, 125 and  463, 263, 204 and 463, 263, 126 are a clear first indication for an impact shock event that has caused a shock pressure of around 22 GPa ! Further indication comes from the Raman-spectrum of quartz from sample-site 23 collected near the small town Marble Bar, that originates from the western crater-rim-area of the impact crater, which also shows clear shifts of the main Raman peaks to the lower frequencies : 463, 262, 204 and 125 cm-1  \r\nMicroscopic images of some of the analysed quartz grains may provide further proof for a shock-event.

In this sequel, we construct a non-Abelian Dirac-Born-Infeld action functional for such pairs when the target spacetime is equipped with a background (dilaton, metric, B)-field from closed strings. We next develop a technical tool needed to study variations of this action and apply it to derive the first variation of with respect. The equations of motion that govern the dynamics of D-branes then follow. We introduce a new action standard for D-branes that is to D-branes as the Polyakov action is to fundamental strings. This \u2018standard action\u2019 is abstractly a non-Abelian gauged sigma model based on maps from an Azumaya\/matrix manifold with a fundamental module with a connection enhanced by the dilaton term, the gauge-theory term, and the Chern-Simons\/Wess-Zumino term that couples to Ramond-Ramond field. In a special situation, this new theory merges the theory of harmonic maps and a gauge theory, with a nilpotent type fuzzy extension. A complete action for a D-brane world-volume must include also the Chern-Simons\/Wess-Zumino term that governs how the D-brane world-volume couples with the Ramond-Ramond fields .

{"vixra_id":"2201.0011","title":"The Electromagnetic Field Outside the Steadily Rotating Relativistic Uniform System","abstract":"Using the method of retarded potentials approximate formulas are obtained that describe the electromagnetic field outside the relativistic uniform system in the form of a charged sphere rotating at a constant speed. For the near, middle and far zones the corresponding expressions are found for the scalar and vector potentials, as well as for the electric and magnetic fields. Then these expressions are assessed for correspondence to the Laplace equations for potentials and fields. One of the purposes is to test the truth of the assumption that the scalar potential and the electric field depend neither on the value of the angular velocity of rotation of the sphere nor on the direction to the point where the field is measured. However, calculations show that potentials and fields increase as the observation point gets closer to the sphere\u2019s equator and to the sphere\u2019s surface, compared with the case for a stationary sphere. In this case, additions are proportional to the square of the angular velocity of rotation, the square of the sphere\u2019s radius and inversely proportional to the square of the speed of light. The largest found relative increase in potentials and fields could reach the value of 4% for the rapidly rotating neutron star PSR J1614-2230, if the star were charged. For a proton, a similar increase in fields on its surface near the equator reaches 54%.","category":"Classical Physics","authors":["Sergey G. Fedosin"],"published":"2022-01-02"}

Here it will be briefly summarized how the 5-dimensional space-time as a \"measuring instrument\" determines the properties of space-time. It is then briefly shown that the speed of light is not a natural constant, but how it is derived from the only natural constant (the circle number \u03c0) by radius of the earth and rotational speed of the earth.","category":"Quantum Gravity and String Theory","authors":["Manfred U.

{"vixra_id":"2201.0002","title":"Notes on Prime Numbers Regularity on Composite Numbers, Formal Representations and Riemann Hypothesis","abstract":"The purpose of this paper is to show, through the regularities that emerge on composite numbers, some formal representations of primality, set of prime numbers and sequence of prime numbers. These regularities will also be seen in the context of the Riemann hypothesis. \r\nThis work has been divided into three parts. \r\nIn the first part two formulas will be identified, defined in N_(>0)^2\u2192N_(>8), that describe the infinite sequences of infinite composite odd numbers. On the basis of these formulas, two definitions will follow, both of primality and of sets of prime numbers. In addition, graphs will be used to better represent the results and the regularities that have emerged, as well as some examples on the efficiency of the formulas found for the purposes of primality.\r\nIn the second part, through an indicator function (or characteristic) and a generating function, we will try to represent a sequence of prime numbers starting both from the two primality definitions identified above, and from the simple definition of prime number. \r\nIn the third part we will try to generalize the two formulas found in the first part to domains other than N_(>0). The definitions given above will be adapted to the new formulas and, lastly, the results obtained will be analysed in the context of the Riemann hypothesis.","category":"Number Theory","authors":["Federico Romagnoli"],"published":"2022-01-01"}

The recommended theoretical value for the strong coupling constant is \u03b1s=Euler's number\/Gelfond's constant.  It will turn out that this value is the key that solves many problems of Physics. \u03a4hey will be found a total of ten formulas for the strong coupling constant. First we will find the beautiful unity formulas that connect the strong coupling constant and the Fine-structure constant. It will be presented the mathematical formulas that connect dimensionless physical constants with the strong coupling constant. Also we will find the formula for the Gravitational constant with exact numerical value. Finally we will be presented the formula for the Cosmological constant.","category":"Nuclear and Atomic Physics","authors":["Stergios Pellis"],"published":"2022-01-01"}
